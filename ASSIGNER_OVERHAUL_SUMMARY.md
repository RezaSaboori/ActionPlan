# Assigner Agent Overhaul - Implementation Summary

## Date: October 26, 2025

## Overview
Successfully overhauled the Assigner agent to use the Ministry of Health organizational structure reference document directly instead of RAG tools. The agent now assigns actions to specific job positions using exact terminology while considering organizational levels and implementing batch processing for scalability.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Configuration Settings (`config/settings.py`)

**Added new settings:**
```python
assigner_reference_doc: str = Field(default="assigner_tools/En/Assigner refrence.md", env="ASSIGNER_REFERENCE_DOC")
assigner_batch_size: int = Field(default=15, env="ASSIGNER_BATCH_SIZE")
assigner_batch_threshold: int = Field(default=30, env="ASSIGNER_BATCH_THRESHOLD")
```

**Deprecated setting:**
- Commented out `assigner_retrieval_mode` (line 142) - no longer needed as Assigner doesn't use RAG

---

### 2. System Prompt (`config/prompts.py`)

**Replaced `ASSIGNER_PROMPT` with comprehensive new prompt that:**
- Emphasizes assignment to **specific job positions** (not general parties)
- Includes organizational level awareness (Ministry/University/Center)
- Provides detailed 5-level hospital hierarchy structure
- Includes shift-based vs administrative position considerations
- Provides clear examples of correct vs incorrect assignments
- Instructs to correct existing assignments to match reference document
- Specifies enhanced JSON output format with new fields

**Key improvements:**
- Added organizational structure reference from the document
- Emphasized exact terminology matching
- Included collaborator identification based on hierarchy
- Added shift type specification

---

### 3. AssignerAgent Class (`agents/assigner.py`)

**Removed RAG dependency:**
- Removed `HybridRAG` from `__init__` parameters
- Removed `protocols_rag` instance variable
- Removed `_get_role_context()` method
- Removed `retrieval_mode` setting usage

**Added reference document loading:**
- New `_load_reference_document()` method that:
  - Tries multiple path resolutions (configured path, relative to cwd, relative to agents dir)
  - Loads entire reference document at initialization
  - Includes error handling for missing document
  - Logs successful load with character count

**Implemented batch processing:**
- New `_assign_responsibilities_batched()` method
- Automatic batch splitting when action count exceeds threshold (default: 30)
- Configurable batch size (default: 15 actions per batch)
- Per-batch error handling with fallback to default assignments
- Progress logging for each batch

**Enhanced assignment logic:**
- `_assign_responsibilities()` now:
  - Accepts `user_config` parameter
  - Includes full reference document in prompt
  - Passes organizational level to LLM
  - Uses temperature 0.1 for consistency
  - Includes detailed instructions for specific job position selection
  
- `_apply_default_assignments()` now:
  - Uses organizational level to determine appropriate default roles
  - Applies reference document terminology
  - Includes Ministry/University/Center level defaults
  - Returns new fields: `organizational_level`, `shift_type`

**New features:**
- Multi-path document resolution for flexibility
- Batch processing with progress tracking
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Organizational level-aware defaults

---

### 4. Workflow Orchestration (`workflows/orchestration.py`)

**Modified assigner initialization (line 73):**
- Before: `assigner = AssignerAgent("assigner", dynamic_settings, main_hybrid_rag, markdown_logger)`
- After: `assigner = AssignerAgent("assigner", dynamic_settings, markdown_logger)`

**Updated assigner_node function:**
- Now passes `user_config` to assigner:
  ```python
  input_data = {
      "prioritized_actions": state["timed_actions"],
      "user_config": state.get("user_config", {})
  }
  ```
- Enhanced logging to include organizational level

---

## Key Benefits

### 1. Performance
- ✅ No RAG dependency = faster execution (no vector/graph database queries)
- ✅ Batch processing prevents context overflow for large action lists
- ✅ Single document load at initialization (not per-action)

### 2. Accuracy
- ✅ Uses official Ministry of Health organizational structure
- ✅ Assigns to specific job positions (not vague roles)
- ✅ Exact terminology matching with reference document
- ✅ Organizational level-aware assignments

### 3. Consistency
- ✅ All assignments use standardized job titles
- ✅ Temperature 0.1 ensures consistent terminology
- ✅ Reference document is single source of truth

### 4. Scalability
- ✅ Batch processing handles any number of actions
- ✅ Configurable batch size and threshold
- ✅ Per-batch error isolation

---

## Configuration Options

Users can customize behavior via environment variables:

```bash
# Reference document path
ASSIGNER_REFERENCE_DOC="assigner_tools/En/Assigner refrence.md"

# Batch processing
ASSIGNER_BATCH_SIZE=15              # Actions per batch
ASSIGNER_BATCH_THRESHOLD=30         # When to start batching

# LLM settings (existing)
ASSIGNER_PROVIDER=ollama
ASSIGNER_MODEL=gpt-oss:20b
ASSIGNER_TEMPERATURE=0.1
```

---

## Output Format

The Assigner now returns actions with enhanced metadata:

```json
{
  "assigned_actions": [
    {
      "action": "Original action description",
      "who": "Specific job title from reference (e.g., 'Head of Emergency Department')",
      "when": "Timing specification",
      "collaborators": ["Specific job titles", "Not departments"],
      "resources_needed": ["Required resources"],
      "verification": "Completion verification method",
      "sources": ["Original source citations"],
      "priority_level": "immediate|short-term|long-term",
      "organizational_level": "ministry|university|center",
      "shift_type": "shift-based|administrative|continuous|as-needed"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Organizational Level Mapping

### Ministry Level
Assigns to:
- Deputy Ministries (Health, Treatment, Education, Research, etc.)
- General Directorates (Legal Affairs, HR, Financial Affairs)
- Centers (Network Management, Emergency and Disaster Management)
- Offices (Communicable Diseases, Non-Communicable Diseases)

### University Level
Assigns to:
- Vice-Presidencies (Education, Research, Health, Treatment)
- Directorates under vice-presidencies
- Schools (Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing)
- Research Centers and Institutes
- County Health Centers

### Center/Hospital Level
Assigns to 5-level hospital hierarchy:
- **Level 1**: Hospital President/CEO, Hospital Manager
- **Level 2**: Matron/Director of Nursing Services, Financial Manager
- **Level 3**: Clinical Supervisor, Hospital Technical Officer
- **Level 4**: Head Nurse of the Ward, Head of Emergency Department
- **Level 5**: Nurses, Physicians, Paraclinical Staff

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with different organizational levels:**
   ```bash
   python main.py generate --name "Test Plan" --timing "Immediate" \
     --level ministry --phase response --subject war
   ```

2. **Test batch processing:**
   - Generate plan with >30 actions to trigger batching
   - Verify batch logs in output
   - Check all actions are assigned

3. **Verify terminology:**
   - Check that "who" fields use exact reference document titles
   - Verify no generic terms like "Medical Staff" or "Support Teams"
   - Confirm organizational level matching

4. **Test reference document loading:**
   - Verify initialization logs show successful document load
   - Test with missing document (should raise FileNotFoundError)

---

## Migration Notes

**Breaking Changes:**
- AssignerAgent no longer accepts `protocols_rag` parameter
- Workflow must pass `user_config` to assigner

**Backward Compatibility:**
- If `user_config` is missing, defaults to 'center' level
- All existing action metadata is preserved
- Default assignments provide graceful fallback
