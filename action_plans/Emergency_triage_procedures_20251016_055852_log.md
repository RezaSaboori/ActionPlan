**🔄 Retry Attempt:**

- Reason: The action list demonstrates a good effort to map policy content to operational actions, but several key quality issues undermine its reliability. Many actions reference the same source lines (301-310) while describing distinct activities, suggesting that the source mapping may not actually support each action. The source citations lack hierarchical context (e.g., Document > Section > Subsection) and do not provide line numbers that clearly contain the referenced content. Timing descriptors such as "During crisis conditions" are too vague for implementation. While the actions are generally specific in terms of who, what, and when, the lack of measurable metrics and detailed implementation steps reduces their actionability. Overall, the plan needs refinement to ensure each action is fully traceable, accurate, and actionable.

**🔄 Retry Attempt:**
- Stage: prioritizer

- Reason: The prioritized actions demonstrate a clear focus on oxygen supply resilience, but several key quality criteria are not fully met. Source citations lack node identifiers and line numbers, making traceability impossible. Action descriptions are generally specific but omit responsible roles, detailed implementation steps, and clear dependency mapping. The plan also appears to overlook other critical resilience domains such as water, sanitation, staff protection, and mental health support, which are essential under combined war and sanctions scenarios. Accuracy cannot be fully verified without source verification, raising uncertainty about the fidelity of the actions to the referenced document.
