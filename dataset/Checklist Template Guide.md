## Checklist Profile for the Comprehensive War/Sanction Preparedness Plan

### Target Audience

Checklists for the Comprehensive War/Sanction Preparedness Plan are designed for two primary groups:

  * **Managers and Headquarters Experts (Ministry/University Level):** This group requires defined procedures for policy-making and decision-making to expedite coordination and maintain a unified chain of command.
      * *Example:* Identifying and establishing support contracts with domestic knowledge-based companies for the repair and supply of medical equipment parts.
  * **Frontline Implementers and Staff:** Final implementers require a tool that is fast, directive, and free of extraneous details to perform their duties effectively.
      * *Example:* Triage nurse, facilities technical staff, warehouse manager.

## Part One: Specifications

**1. Checklist Name:**
Should be defined according to the main guideline document.

  * *Example:* Protocol for Reverse Evacuation and Capacity Generation.

**2. Relevant Domain:**
The relevant directorate or organization.

  * *Example:* Deputy Ministry of Treatment.

**3. Crisis Scope:**
War / Mass Casualty Incidents or Sanctions, as defined in the main guideline.

**4. Checklist Type:**
Preparedness Phase / Action-Response Phase, as defined in the main guideline.

**5. Reference Protocols:**
It is preferred to use protocols already included in the Comprehensive Plan document. This plan references higher-level, officially communicated protocols. Many domains—such as firefighting, patient safety, and radiological incident management—have valid national or international documents and directives. When developing new documents, these sources must be considered as a foundation, with their content localized and adapted to the specific conditions of a war or sanctions crisis.

  * *Example:* To develop a checklist for initial actions when encountering a chemically contaminated patient, one can use existing protocols from the National Civil Defense Organization as a starting point, adapting them to the capabilities and structure of the nation's hospitals (e.g., roles of supervisors, environmental health units, etc.) instead of starting from scratch.

**6. Operational Level:**

  * **Level 1: Ministry of Health HQ (National Tactical Level):** Focuses on policy-making, national coordination, strategic stockpile management, allocation of macro-resources to universities, and national monitoring and oversight.
      * *Example:* Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the allocation and shipment of strategic medications to a university in a crisis-affected region.
  * **Level 2: University of Medical Sciences HQ (Regional Operational Level):** Focuses on regional command, managing resource distribution at the provincial level, coordinating between hospitals, activating designated support hospitals, and reporting to the Ministry HQ.
      * *Example:* Decision-making flowchart for transferring a patient from a primary designated hospital to its support hospital based on capacity and trauma level.
  * **Level 3: Frontline Service Delivery Centers/Units (Local Operational Level):** Includes hospitals, comprehensive health centers, emergency medical services stations, etc. This level is responsible for the direct execution of operations, patient treatment, internal resource management, facility protection, and reporting to the university.
      * *Example:* Checklist of actions for the hospital facilities manager during the first hour of a power outage.

**7. Process Owner:**
The central department or office responsible for communicating and overseeing the protocol's implementation.

  * *Example:* Center for Hospital Management and Clinical Excellence.

**8. Actor(s) / Implementer(s):**
The responsible person(s) by position/title within the operational level.

  * *Example:* Heads of clinical departments, head nurses, discharge officers.

**9. Operations Commander:**
The responsible individual at the operational level.

  * *Example:* Clinical Operations Commander (Hospital President or Treatment Deputy).

**Note:** Responsibilities during a crisis must be **clear and unambiguous**. Documents, especially checklists, should **not** be written for specific individuals (e.g., "Mr. Smith") but for **defined organizational roles** (e.g., Hospital Director, Facilities Manager, Clinical Supervisor). This ensures that processes are not disrupted by personnel changes.

  * *Example:* In a power outage checklist, duties are defined as follows:
      * **Facilities Manager:** Check and report generator fuel status.
      * **Nursing Supervisor:** Report the list of ventilator-dependent patients to the EOC.
      * **Logistics Manager:** Coordinate a secure route for emergency fuel supply.

**10. Checklist Activation Trigger:**
Every process must have a clear and specific trigger that defines the exact starting point of the operation. This prevents premature, costly actions or disastrously late responses.

  * *Examples:*
      * **Trigger:** Activate this process upon the declaration of "Code Orange" by the University EOC or a nationwide power outage lasting more than 30 minutes.
      * **Trigger:** If the stock of drug 'X' in the central warehouse falls below 48 hours of consumption, initiate the emergency supply request process.

**11. Checklist Objective:**
Defines the final goal of the checklist's execution.

  * *Example:* Create a minimum of 50 vacant inpatient beds and completely halt all elective services within the first 2 hours of activation.

**12. Executive Steps:**
Some checklists, particularly in the action-response phase, have time-sensitive steps that must be detailed by time and responsible party.

  * *Example:* Executive steps for the Reverse Evacuation and Capacity Generation Protocol:
      * **Part 1 (First 30 Minutes):** Organization and cessation of non-critical services by the Clinical Operations Commander.
      * **Part 2 (First 2 Hours):** Execution of evacuation and capacity generation by Department Heads, Head Nurses, and the Discharge Team.
      * **Part 3 (Continuous Actions):** Preparation for victim admission and monitoring by the Clinical Operations Commander and management team.

## Part Two: Checklist Content

For each executive step, a table should be organized as follows:

| Row | Action | Status | Remarks / Report |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

1.  **Action:** Checklists must be short, directive, checkable, and aligned with executive directives and protocols. Crisis documents must be understandable and executable under severe psychological pressure and in the shortest possible time. Complex language, long sentences, and ambiguous phrases lead to confusion and delays. For each action, use **simple words, short sentences, and clear, direct, command-style verbs**.

      * **Bad Example (Complex and Passive):** *Necessary preparations for the provision and storage of drinking water required for staff and patients for a three-day period should be made as soon as possible, and a report thereof should be sent to management.*
      * **Good Example (Simple and Directive):**
          * Store safe drinking water for 72 hours.
          * Calculate 4 liters of water per day per active bed.
          * Record water inventory on the daily checklist.

2.  **Status:** The status options should be configured based on the action type.

      * For urgent items, the status should be options like: **Executed, Communicated, Reported**.
      * In other cases, phrases like **In Progress** or **Not Applicable** can be used.
      * The status must be clear and checkable.

3.  **Remarks / Report:** Relevant explanations related to the action should be entered here.

### Example Checklist Content Table:

| Action | Status | Remarks / Report |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Announce the immediate and complete stop of all elective surgeries. | ☐ Communicated | Responsible: Head of Operating Room. Patients prepared for surgery should be returned to their respective wards. |
