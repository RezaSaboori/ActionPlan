## Introduction

### Executive Summary

This document, as a high-level policy document, outlines the necessary action items at the level of government, Ministry of Health, and selected universities and healthcare service delivery centers during a crisis period of sanctions and/or war (or both). The purpose of this document is to develop an operational plan for the crisis period of sanctions and war; it is not intended to detail the specifics required for the frontline operational level, and these plans will be developed following the presentation of this document through expert sessions and utilizing the experiences of frontline managers.

#### 1. Main Problem and Necessity of the Plan

The country's health system faces a wide spectrum of complex and multifaceted threats that extend beyond managing war casualties. Probable scenarios include economic warfare and intensification of sanctions (with activation of the snapback mechanism and comprehensive Security Council sanctions) aimed at paralyzing the supply chain of medicines and equipment; military engagement and attacks aimed at destroying critical infrastructure such as electricity and water and direct damage to healthcare facilities; unconventional threats (chemical, biological, nuclear); and a combined scenario (simultaneous war and intensification of sanctions). The collapse of the health system under these conditions will be equivalent to the collapse of public hope and the weakening of national resilience. This document is an operational and strategic roadmap for increasing resilience and ensuring the continuity of essential health services delivery under the most severe conditions.

#### 2. Overall Strategy and Governing Principles

The main strategy of this document is the transformation of healthcare facilities from vulnerable entities to **self-sufficient and resilient fortresses** through an integrated and systemic approach. This strategy is founded on four fundamental principles:

- **Principle of Continuity of Operations:** Ensures that the delivery of essential health services is not interrupted under any circumstances. This is achieved through flexibility, creation of surplus capacities, and planning for severe crisis scenarios.
- **Principle of Unified Command and Control:** Emphasizes the existence of a clear, centralized, and pre-practiced command structure to prevent confusion and contradictory orders.
- **Principle of Optimal Resource Utilization:** Mandates that scarce resources (human resources, medicines, blood, and time) must be allocated based on scientific logic and prioritization (triage) to achieve the maximum possible outcome (for example: saving the greatest number of lives).
- **Principle of Protection of Staff and Patients:** Considers ensuring the physical and psychological security and health of healthcare personnel an ethical and strategic imperative, on par with treating patients.

#### 3. Unified Command and Control Structure

For effective crisis management, a three-level command structure based on the Incident Command System (ICS) model has been designed:

- **Strategic Level (National):** The **Supreme Council of Health in Crisis** chaired by the First Vice President and including key ministers is established. This council is responsible for making major national decisions, mobilizing cross-ministerial resources, and allocating emergency budgets.
- **Tactical Level (Ministry of Health):** The **National Health Crisis Operations Command Center (ICS)** commanded by the Minister of Health is the operational brain. This center is responsible for policymaking, managing strategic reserves, issuing protocols, and intelligently allocating resources to universities.
- **Operational Level (Universities and Hospitals):** The **University/Hospital Crisis Operations Command Center (EOC)** commanded by the university president or hospital director is the executive arm on the frontline. These centers are responsible for implementing protocols, managing local resources, treating casualties, and continuous reporting to the national command center.

#### 4. Summary of Key Responsibilities of the Three Levels

- **Government Level (Strategic):**
  - Approval of laws and major appropriations for preparedness and response.
  - Establishment of a National Health Crisis Fund and facilitation of financial and foreign procurement processes.
  - Cross-sectoral coordination at the national level (such as coordination with the Ministries of Energy, Petroleum, Defense, and Interior) and in the financial domain (with the Central Bank and Planning and Budget Organization)
  - Legal and diplomatic support for health system operations.
- **Ministry of Health Command Center Level (Tactical):**
  - Development and issuance of standards, protocols, and technical and clinical guidelines.
  - Establishment, management, and distribution of national strategic reserves (medicines, equipment, vaccines, specialized kits).
  - Leadership, supervision, and continuous evaluation of the preparedness of all universities and hospitals.
  - Establishment of an integrated command, control, and information system for intelligent crisis management.
- **Universities and Healthcare Facilities Level (Operational):**
  - Implementation, localization, and continuous practice of all issued protocols.
  - Implementation of three-layer defense for critical infrastructure (electricity, water, fuel, oxygen, information) and efforts toward temporary self-sufficiency of healthcare facilities.
  - Human resource management (shift scheduling, call-up, training, and psychological support) and organization of physical space (fortification, shelter, EOC).
  - Direct implementation of clinical operations (triage, mass casualty management) and public health operations (epidemic prevention) on the scene.

 This document, with a comprehensive approach, guides the health system from a reactive state to proactive preparedness. Its successful implementation will ensure the survival of the health system and citizens' lives in the most critical moments.

### Overview

Given the sensitive regional conditions and potential threats ahead, maintaining the integrity and efficiency of the country's health system as one of the main pillars of national resilience is of vital importance. Modern wars, with their complex and multifaceted nature, impose a challenge beyond managing war casualties on the healthcare system. Disruption of critical infrastructure such as electricity, water, and gas; disruption of the supply chain of medicines and medical equipment; exponential increase in trauma patients; emergence of mental health crises; and the possibility of using unconventional weapons are only part of the probable scenarios that can lead the health system to collapse in the shortest time.

This document, with a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective and with the aim of preserving citizens' lives and ensuring the continuity of essential health and medical services delivery under the most severe conditions, has been developed as a comprehensive strategic and operational (high-level) plan. The success of this plan depends on accurate understanding of the roles and responsibilities of key actors at three strategic, managerial, and operational levels: 1. **Government and Sovereign Institutions:** Including logistical support, security provision, emergency resource allocation, and major national coordination that is beyond the Ministry of Health's authority. 2. **Ministry of Health Command Center and Affiliated Organizations:** As the thinking brain and crisis command center, responsible for policymaking, providing strategic medicines and equipment, issuing protocols, and supervising the proper implementation of plans. 3. **Medical Sciences Universities and Service Delivery Centers:** As executive arms on the frontline, directly responsible for hospital preparation, human resource management, treating casualties, and providing health services at the regional level.

The main objective of this plan is to increase the resilience and response capacity of the health system through integrated coordination among these three levels, accurate identification of hazards, proactive planning, and resource organization so that during a crisis, public health can be protected with minimal damage and maximum efficiency.

## Section One: Hazard Assessment and General Principles

### Section Introduction

This section forms the theoretical and conceptual foundation of the entire document and serves as a strategic compass for all subsequent actions. Modern wars, with their complex and multifaceted nature, impose a challenge beyond merely managing war casualties on the healthcare system. In this regard, to develop an effective plan, one must first thoroughly understand the enemy and the playing field.

Accordingly, the main threat scenarios that confront the country's health system with fundamental challenges are realistically analyzed, and then the fundamental principles that must govern all actions and protocols like an unwritten law are explained. A deep understanding of this section is mandatory for correct interpretation and implementation of other sections of the document, as it specifies why and based on what philosophy subsequent technical and operational actions are designed. This document essentially illustrates how to perform the envisioned roles in such crises for command and operational levels.

### Protocol 1.1: Threat Scenario Analysis

**1.1.1. Economic-Political Crisis Scenario (Economic Warfare and Intensification of Sanctions)**

This scenario is considered a war of attrition and silent warfare against the country's health infrastructure, pursued through tools such as activating the snapback mechanism.

#### Threat Analysis

- **Cutting or severe restriction of foreign currency for imports:** This action targets the lifeline of the health system. Imports of exclusive medicines, chemotherapy and biotechnology drugs, specialized diagnostic kits, spare parts for advanced medical equipment (CT, MRI machines, linear accelerators), and pharmaceutical raw materials without domestic production are directly stopped or severely restricted.
- **Paralysis of the banking system and international logistics:** Secondary sanctions deter international transportation and insurance companies from cooperating with the country. Consequently, even if foreign currency is obtained from informal sources, the process of purchasing and transferring goods is accompanied by exorbitant costs, lengthy delays, and high risk of cargo confiscation.

#### Strategic Consequences

- **Increase in preventable mortality:** Patients with cancer, specific diseases (hemophilia, thalassemia), and those requiring complex surgeries will be the first victims of this scenario
- **Severe decline in service quality:** Wear and breakdown of medical equipment due to lack of spare parts
- **Creation of black market and counterfeit drugs:** Threat to pharmaceutical security of society
- **Erosion of social capital:** Severe decline in public trust in governance and government accountability

**1.1.2. Limited or Extensive Military Engagement Scenario (Conventional War)**

This scenario confronts the health system with multiple and severe shocks in a short time frame.

#### Threat Analysis

- **Collapse of Critical Infrastructure:**
  - **Electricity:** Nationwide power outage is equivalent to absolute shutdown of hospitals. Emergency generators are sufficient only for a few hours and for critical departments (operating room, ICU)
  - **Water:** Water cutoff makes central sterilization, dialysis, public hygiene, and infection control impossible
  - **Communications:** Disruption of the "nervous system" of the health system, disruption in crisis command and coordination
- **Direct damage to hospitals and pharmaceutical warehouses:** Targeting soft targets to paralyze the country's response capacity
- **Acute human resource crisis:** Phenomenon of "service abandonment" among healthcare personnel due to security threats and severe psychological pressure
- **Risk of establishing defective cycles:** Increasing dissatisfaction due to failure to provide facilities and general service delivery

#### Strategic Consequences

- **Inability to manage mass casualties:** Rapid saturation of the healthcare system and resorting to strategic multi-path triage
- **Cessation of routine services:** Stoppage of care for other emergency patients and chronic patients
- **Creation of management vacuum:** Disintegration of crisis management structure

**1.1.3. Unconventional Threat Scenario (Chemical, Biological, Nuclear, Radiological)**

The most complex and destructive type of threat requiring completely specialized knowledge, equipment, and protocols.

#### Threat Analysis

- Use of chemical agents (nerve gases), biological agents (anthrax), or radiological agents (dirty bomb)
- Creation of casualties with different clinical symptoms requiring decontamination, isolation, and specific antidotes

#### Strategic Consequences

- Public panic and societal paralysis
- Widespread contamination of resources
- Complete inability of the healthcare system

**1.1.4. Combined Scenario (Simultaneous War and Sanctions)**

The worst possible case where the challenges of both above scenarios occur simultaneously and intensify each other's effects, placing the health system at serious risk, requiring double and special preparedness.

**Table 1.1: Matrix of Amplifying Effects of Scenarios on the Health System**

| **Key Indicator** | **Sanctions Scenario** | **War Scenario** | **Combined Scenario** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Medicine Supply Chain** | Severe disruption in imports, shortage of imported items and failure to supply pharmaceutical raw materials | Disruption in domestic distribution, warehouse destruction | Complete collapse of supply chain |
| **Infrastructure** | Mainly intact | Extensive damage and frequent outages | Extensive damage without repair capability |
| **Human Resources** | Job burnout, tendency to emigrate | Casualties, acute exhaustion, service abandonment | High casualties, complete collapse of motivation |
| **Need for Services** | Increase in chronic patients without medicine | Explosive increase in trauma casualties | Explosive combination of casualties and chronic patients |
| **Response Capacity** | Gradual decrease | Explosive decrease | Complete damage |

### Protocol 1.2: Principles and Foundations Governing the Plan

The success of this document depends on the adherence of all health system components to four fundamental principles that, like main pillars, direct and support all actions and programs.

#### 1.2.1. Principle of Continuity of Operations

This principle is the most vital pillar of crisis preparedness and is based on the philosophy that the delivery of essential health services must never be stopped under any circumstances.

**Operational Components:**

- Designing systems with high flexibility and ability to adapt to changing conditions
- Creating surplus capacities and defining backup healthcare facilities
- Ability to rapidly relocate resources and personnel
- Planning for service continuity even with loss of 50% of resources

#### 1.2.2. Principle of Unified Command and Control

This principle emphasizes the necessity of having a clear, centralized command structure agreed upon by all actors.

**Operational Components:**

- **Pre-crisis design:** Command structure must be designed and practiced before crisis occurrence
- **Precise definition of authorities and responsibilities:** Prevention of time waste and issuance of contradictory orders
- **Transparent chain of command:** From national level to hospital level
- **Integrated communications system:** Ensuring information flow at all levels

**1.2.3. Principle of Optimal Resource Utilization**

This principle mandates that allocation of scarce resources must be based on specific and scientific logic with the goal of achieving maximum outcome.

**Operational Components:**

- **Resource assessment:** Human resources, medicines, equipment, blood, and time
- **Evidence-based prioritization:** Saving the greatest possible number of lives
- **Decision support systems:** Tools for rapid decision-making assistance
- **Continuous monitoring of resource consumption**

#### 1.2.4. Principle of Protection of Staff and Patients

This principle is an ethical and strategic imperative according to which ensuring the physical and psychological security and health of healthcare personnel is a priority on par with treating patients.

**Operational Components:**

- **Provision of appropriate and reliable space**
- **Provision of personal protective equipment (PPE)**
- **Work environment safety:** Physical protection of healthcare facilities
- **Provision of psychological support:** Counseling and treatment of job burnout
- **Ensuring security of staff families:** Necessary condition for effective staff presence

**Table 1.2: Matrix of Key Responsibilities in Threat Management**

| **Responsibility Area** | **Government Level** | **Ministry of Health Command Center** | **Universities and Healthcare Facilities** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Major Policymaking** | Approval of laws and appropriations | Formulation of sectoral policies | Implementation and localization |
| **Resource Provision** | Emergency budget allocation | Distribution and supervision | Management and consumption optimization |
| **Coordination** | Cross-sectoral coordination | Intra-sectoral coordination | Local coordination |
| **Implementation and Operations** | Major oversight and evaluation | Monitoring, leadership, and support | Direct implementation |

### Protocol 1.3: Preparedness Levels and Unified Response Codes (Trigger Response System)

#### Protocol Philosophy and Objective

In order to transition from reactive and order-based management to an **intelligent, proactive, and automated (trigger) system**, this protocol defines a common language and standardized operational framework for the entire country's health system. The main objective is to create a tiered response mechanism in which each threat level automatically activates a predefined set of actions, minimizing the need for issuing case-by-case directives in the midst of a crisis. These codes are announced by the **National Health Crisis Operations Command Center (ICS)** and are mandatory for all levels (command center, universities, and healthcare facilities).

#### Definition of Four Preparedness and Response Levels

##### White Status (Sustained Readiness - Code White): Normal Conditions

- **Definition:** Normal situation and peacetime; absence of imminent threat. This status is the "planting season" for crisis preparedness.
- **Key Actions:**
  - **Planning and optimization:** Development, review, and localization of crisis operational plans at university and hospital levels.
  - **Training and capacity building:** Continuous conduct of training courses (triage, damage control surgery, psychological support) and tabletop exercises for managers.
  - **Exercise and evaluation:** Conducting operational exercises (announced and surprise) at least quarterly and recording strengths and weaknesses in the "National Online Crisis Preparedness Monitoring System (NOCPMS)".
  - **Creation and completion of reserves:** Provision and regular rotation of strategic reserves of medicines, equipment, and supplies based on issued standards (bringing inventory to 100% of defined level).
  - **Maintenance and fortification:** Inspection, repair, and preventive maintenance of critical infrastructure (generators, water tanks, oxygen generation systems) and implementation of fortification projects.

##### Yellow Status (Warning and Alert - Code Yellow): Probability of Crisis Occurrence

- **Definition:** Conditions in which political, military, or security tensions have increased and there is a probability of engagement or crisis in the near future (e.g., coming weeks). This status is the time for "preparing for the storm".
- **Key Actions:**
  - **Limited EOC activation:** The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the university level and designated hospitals is activated on a limited, 24-hour basis, and daily coordination meetings are held.
  - **Immediate update and completion of inventory:** Review of the status of all strategic and consumable reserves and immediate action to bring them to 120% of defined capacity.
  - **Alert of rapid response teams:** All members of rapid response teams are placed on alert and their duty and call-up schedules are finalized.
  - **Final infrastructure review:** Hot testing of all generators, backup sources of water and oxygen, and emergency communication systems (satellite phone, radio).
  - **Reduction of elective surgeries:** Gradual and managed reduction of non-emergency (elective) surgeries to keep inpatient and intensive care bed capacity available.
  - **Limited notification to staff:** Awareness of middle managers and key staff of the situation and possibility of call-up.

##### Red Status (Active Crisis - Code Red): Crisis Occurrence

- **Definition:** Commencement of military engagement, occurrence of attack, or widespread crisis. This status is "entering the heart of the storm".
- **Key Actions:**
  - **Complete activation of command structure:** Complete deployment of **Health War Room (EOC)** and assumption of unified operational command by the university president/hospital director.
  - **Implementation of operational protocols:** Immediate commencement of mass casualty triage protocols, evacuation of vulnerable departments, and activation of alternative treatment spaces.
  - **Universal call-up of forces:** Call-up of all human resources (official, contractual, resident physicians) and registered volunteer forces based on human resource protocols.
  - **Complete cessation of non-essential services:** Cessation of all elective surgeries and non-emergency outpatient services. Concentration of all hospital capacity on crisis management.
  - **Exercise of emergency authorities:** Use of delegated authorities for procurement without formalities, temporary deployment of personnel, and use of private and non-governmental public sector facilities.
  - **Continuous communication with higher command:** Regular reporting (every 6 hours) to the Ministry of Health Operations Command Center.

##### Purple Status - or Red 2 (Catastrophic Crisis - Code Black): Communication Cutoff and Survival

- **Definition:** Severe scenario in which the country's communication infrastructure has collapsed and communication between center and frontline (Ministry command center with universities) is cut off for an extended period (more than 6 hours). This status is the "battle for survival".
- **Key Actions:**
  - **Implementation of "fire at will principle":** Upon diagnosis of **Purple Status (Red 2)**, the president of the medical sciences university acts as **field commander with full authority** and makes all necessary decisions for crisis management in his/her geographical area without needing authorization from the center.
  - **Resource management with survival approach:** Implementation of the strictest resource allocation protocols (secondary triage for resources such as ventilators and operating rooms) with the goal of saving the greatest possible number of lives.
  - **Activation of alternative communication networks:** Attempt to establish communication through all possible methods (trusted courier, amateur radio networks, communication with neighboring provinces).
  - **Unified regional command:** The university president assumes responsibility for coordinating and directing all regional healthcare facilities including governmental, private, military, and charitable health sectors.
  - **Documentation of decisions:** All important decisions and actions must be recorded in the war room logbook to be reported to the central command center after communication is established. The authorities of **Purple Status (Red 2)** will remain in effect until stable communication with the central command center is re-established.

## Section Two: Management of Critical Infrastructure and Strategic Resources and Reserves

### Section Introduction

Modern healthcare facilities are entities heavily dependent on critical infrastructure. Water, electricity, medical gases, supply chain, and information systems are considered the vital arteries of a hospital, and the disruption of any of these, even for a few hours, can rapidly lead to the paralysis of treatment processes and increased patient mortality. In a war scenario, national infrastructure are the enemy's first targets to disable the country's economic and social arteries. Therefore, the main strategy in this section is to move from **"dependence on the national network"** towards **"creating self-sufficient healthcare fortresses"** that can continue operations independently for a specified period (minimum 72 hours) under complete siege conditions.

This is achieved through a **three-layer defense**:

- **First Layer (Prevention and Resilience):** Strengthening and securing the facility's internal infrastructure.
- **Second Layer (Storage and Backup):** Creating on-site backup resources and systems.
- **Third Layer (Alternative Processes):** Designing and practicing alternative methods (usually non-digital and manual) for when main and backup systems fail completely.

Success in this section is a prerequisite for success in all other sections. Without water and electricity, even the best surgeons and most advanced equipment will lose their functionality.

### Protocol 2.1: Ensuring Electric Power Sustainability

### Protocol 2.3: Ensuring Medical Gas Sustainability (Oxygen, Compressed Air, etc.)

Oxygen is the most critical "medication" in hospitals, and interruption of its flow even for minutes can lead to catastrophe. In crisis conditions, oxygen demand (due to trauma casualties and respiratory patients) increases dramatically, while its supply chain (liquid oxygen) and production infrastructure (oxygen concentrators heavily dependent on electricity) are highly vulnerable. Therefore, achieving self-sufficiency and resilience in medical gas supply is a strategic priority.

**Grand Strategy:** Implementation of **three-layer defense** to ensure uninterrupted medical gas flow, especially oxygen.

  - **Integrated Training and Drills:**
    - Holding regular training courses for correct use of all communication layers (wireless, satellite phone, etc.).
    - Execution of quarterly **"Radio Silence" drill** where first layer communication (phone and internet) use is prohibited and all communications must occur through backup layers (2, 3, and 4) to identify and resolve weaknesses.

### Protocol 2.5: National Doctrine for Pharmaceutical and Medical Equipment Supply Chain Sustainability

**Strategic Introduction:**

The pharmaceutical and medical equipment supply chain is the vital artery of the health system in crisis conditions. Any disruption in this chain paralyzes the entire system's response capability. This protocol, as an **integrated operational doctrine**, outlines the duties, authorities, and responsibilities of each governance, headquarters, and operational level to ensure uninterrupted flow of health items from production to consumption. The objective is to transform a vulnerable supply chain into a **resilient, flexible, and intelligent logistics network**.

#### Level 1: Government and Sovereign Entities (Strategic Level)

**Grand Objective:** Creating national protective umbrella, removing legal barriers, and mobilizing cross-ministerial capabilities to support health supply chain.

##### 2.5.1. Approval and Implementation of Emergency Support Laws

## Section Four: Preparedness and Continuity of Health Services in Crisis Situations

### Introduction and Governing Philosophy

This section constitutes the operational heart of the comprehensive preparedness and response document for the health system. While previous sections addressed strengthening infrastructure, resource management, and command structure, this section elaborates on mechanisms that ensure **"the core function of the health system"** - namely, service delivery to the people - is not interrupted even during the darkest days of war, sanctions, and potential epidemics.

The philosophy governing this section represents a **fundamental paradigm shift** from individual-centered medicine to **population-centered medicine** in crisis situations. The objective is no longer to provide the best possible services for one individual, but rather to deliver **"the best possible services to the greatest number of people"** through optimal utilization of severely limited resources. This shift in approach requires deep understanding of the following key concepts:

- **Surge Capacity:** The system's ability to rapidly expand services beyond normal capacity through activation of alternative spaces,召回 of reserve personnel, and process simplification.
- **Triage:** The beating heart of clinical crisis management. A scientific and ethical process for prioritizing patients based on injury severity and survival probability, so that critical resources (surgeon, ICU bed, blood) are allocated to those with the greatest chance of survival. This protocol defines triage in two parallel pathways for war casualties and other emergency patients.
- **Damage Control Surgery:** A staged and rapid approach for severe trauma casualties where the initial goal is not complete repair, but merely control of bleeding and contamination and keeping the patient alive for transfer to ICU. Completion and reconstructive surgeries are deferred until the patient's condition stabilizes.
- **Networking and Unified Command (Network & C&C):** No hospital can manage a crisis alone. Creating an integrated network of designated (frontline) and backup (governmental, private, military) hospitals operating under a centralized Command and Control (C&C) system is critical for intelligent distribution of casualties and preventing the collapse of a single center.
- **Community-Based Care:** In crisis, hospitals must focus on acute and complex cases. The role of comprehensive health centers and mobile teams in managing chronic patients, basic health services, and primary care to prevent hospital saturation plays a critical and irreplaceable role.

This section provides a roadmap for actualizing these concepts at the operational level.

### Protocol 4.1: Key Preparedness Indicators and Continuous Assessment

**Objective:** Transform preparedness from an abstract concept into a **quantifiable and monitorable management dashboard** that enables crisis commanders at all levels to monitor the current status, gaps, and strengths in real-time and make data-driven decisions.

#### Government and Governing Institutions Level

- **Mandate:** Approve regulations requiring all executive agencies (Ministry of Energy, Petroleum, Communications) to provide data related to critical infrastructure sustainability of medical centers to the Ministry of Health monitoring system.

#### Ministry of Health Headquarters Level (Tactical)

  - **Monitoring and Reporting:** Assign a monitoring officer at each medical and health center for continuous and honest data entry into the SAMPAB system.
  - **Gap Analysis:** Continuous analysis of the center's preparedness dashboard, identification of weaknesses (red indicators), and development of operational plans to address them.
  - **Self-Assessment:** Conduct periodic drills and use results to update preparedness indicators.

| **Sample Key Indicators in SAMPAB Dashboard** |     |     |
| --- |     |     | --- | --- |

| **Red Threshold (Example)** | **Indicator** | **Domain** |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Section Five: Physical Space Management, Safety, and Shelter

**Strategic Introduction**

In modern warfare doctrine, medical centers have moved from "safe zone" status to become "strategic targets." Attacking a hospital is not merely destroying a building, but the collapse of a symbol of hope and society's last refuge. Therefore, the physical space of medical centers is no longer a service asset, but a strategic stronghold whose protection is as important as protecting patient and medical staff lives.

This section outlines the roadmap for transforming vulnerable hospitals into "resilient health fortresses." The philosophy governing this roadmap is movement from reactive post-incident management toward proactive and multi-layered passive defense. This strategy rests on three main pillars:

- **Physical Protection:** Structural hardening and critical lifeline protection against direct threats.
- **Operational Continuity:** Ensuring uninterrupted service functioning even in case of damage.
- **Sustainable Command:** Creating secure and impenetrable command centers for operation guidance.

### Key Concept Explanation for Managers

Effective physical space management in crisis is based on four fundamental principles whose deep understanding is essential for planning success:

#### 1. Multi-Layer Hardening Principle

Hardening means creating defense in depth against various threats. This concept is implemented at two levels:

**Structural Hardening:** Strengthening load-bearing building elements (columns, beams, load-bearing walls) for resistance against explosion, earthquake, and fire. This includes using resistant materials, creating redundancy in the structural system, and designing multi-purpose escape routes.

**Non-Structural Hardening:** Securing moving components and equipment that pose the greatest danger during incidents. Research has shown that 80% of earthquake casualties result from falling equipment, glass, and non-structural components rather than complete building collapse.

#### 2. Redundancy and Diversity Principle

No critical function should depend on a single point. This principle is realized at three levels:

- **Spatial Redundancy:** Creating alternative options for critical spaces (second operating room, alternative ICU)
- **System Redundancy:** Multiplying critical systems (multiple generators, different power routes)
- **Management Redundancy:** Multiple command centers where if one is damaged, another activates

#### 3. Adaptability Principle

Physical space must have rapid use change capability. In crisis, it may be necessary to quickly convert a regular ward into an ICU or operating room. This requires designing flexible spaces with adaptable infrastructure.

#### 4. Temporary Self-Sufficiency Principle

The medical center must be able to operate for at least 72 hours without any external support (electricity, water, gas, communications). This time is sufficient for external aid organization and logistics route reopening.

### Protocol 5.1: Comprehensive Hardening and Critical Lifeline Protection

**Objective:** Create an impenetrable physical and infrastructure defensive shell for medical centers, prioritizing low-cost, high-impact actions.

#### 5.1.1. Government Level Duties (Empowerment and Mandate)

- **Create physical protection** for critical outdoor facilities (fuel and oxygen tanks).

- **C) Progressive Upgrade Planning:** Develop a 3-year plan for implementing larger projects such as structural hardening of key departments, fire suppression system upgrade, and creating safe emergency exit routes.

**Protocol 5.2: Multi-Purpose Shelter Design, Equipment, and Management**

**Objective:** Transform shelter from a "hideout" into an "**emergency treatment and survival center**" capable of providing critical medical services under direct threat conditions.

#### 5.2.1. Government and Ministry of Health Headquarters Level Duties (Standardization and Support)

**A) Develop "National Hospital Shelter Standard":** Prepare comprehensive regulations in cooperation with Passive Defense Organization specifying technical, structural, facility, and equipment specifications for hospital shelters.

**B) Design and Provide "Standard Shelter Kits":** Ministry of Health headquarters is required to design and provide pre-prepared packages (kits) for hospitals. These kits must include portable medical equipment, critical medications, water, food, and emergency communication devices.

**C) Create "Designated Shelter Network":** Coordinate with Ministry of Interior and municipalities to identify safe public shelters (such as metro stations) and sign agreements to use them as recovery centers or backup centers in emergency conditions.

#### 5.2.2. University and Medical Centers Level Duties (Implementation and Operations)

**A) Identify and Prepare Primary and Alternative Shelter Spaces:**

- **Primary Shelter:** At the most resistant hospital point (usually basement) with direct access to critical facilities.

### Summary: From Vulnerability to Resilience

Part Five of this document creates a fundamental transformation in perspective toward medical center physical space and transforms them from ordinary service environments into resilient strategic assets. This section rests on three main pillars: **multi-layer hardening** (combining structural and non-structural actions with emphasis on low-cost, high-impact solutions), **multi-purpose shelters** (adaptable spaces capable of conversion into temporary ICU or emergency operating room), and **resilient command centers** (impenetrable EOCs with multiple communication systems). Protocols 5.1 through 5.3 demonstrate that hospitals in wartime conditions must simultaneously undertake three critical missions: life protection, treatment continuity, and operation guidance.

This section's implementation approach is gradual, practical, and effective, starting from a 100-day immediate action program (such as equipment securing and glass safety) and culminating in a 3-year complete hardening plan. The ultimate goal is transformation from reactive approach to proactive strategy where medical centers are not only capable of survival in crisis conditions, but become fortresses for saving lives and symbols of national resistance. Successful implementation of these protocols, while saving countless lives, will maintain public trust in the health system during the most critical moments.

The table below summarizes the duties of the three pillars in physical space and shelter management.

**Summary Table of Physical Space and Shelter Management Responsibilities**

## Section Six: Command, Coordination, and Emergency Financing

**Strategic Introduction: From Bureaucracy to Operational Command**

Under normal circumstances, laws and regulations serve as guarantors of organizational order and discipline; however, in the midst of war, these same laws can become chains shackling field managers and commanders. When every minute matters for saving a human life, delays in procuring a vital medication or deploying a specialized team due to administrative procedures equate to the loss of lives.

Section Six of this document, recognizing this bitter reality, presents a **new management doctrine for crisis conditions**. The core of this doctrine is the **establishment of special legal, financial, and operational pathways** that allow managers at all levels to make critical decisions in the moment with full authority and without fear of subsequent prosecution. The objective is to replace "administrative processes" with "command protocols" and transform "managers" into "operations commanders." This section charts the roadmap for transitioning from a rigid bureaucratic structure to a **flexible, accountable, and powerful command system**.

### Protocol 6.1: Command Structure and Operational Authority Delegation

**Objective:** To establish a clear, unified, and powerful command chain that, while maintaining national coordination, delegates the necessary authority for rapid action to operational levels on the front lines.

#### 6.1.1. Government-Level Responsibilities (Creating the Legal Foundation for Command)

**A) Approval of the "Health System Emergency Management Act":** Urgent submission of a bill to Parliament or the Supreme National Security Council for approval of legislation that:

- **Delegates special authorities to the Minister of Health:** The Minister of Health, as **Commander-in-Chief of Health Operations in Crisis**, shall have full authority to mobilize all public and private sector resources, change the designated use of spaces, and issue binding directives to other agencies in the health domain.
- **Establishes judicial immunity for managers:** Managers and personnel who make urgent decisions within the framework of this document's protocols and under emergency conditions shall be immune from any judicial and administrative prosecution. This provision eliminates the "fear of decision-making."

**B) Activation of the "Supreme Health Council in Crisis":** Immediate formation of this Council chaired by the First Vice President and including key ministers (Interior, Defense, Industry-Mine-Trade, Energy, Petroleum) for cross-sectoral coordination and national support of the Commander-in-Chief of Health Operations' decisions. This Council shall be formed only during wartime crises and shall be solely responsible for commanding health system crisis operations during this period (the duties of this Council shall not overlap with or contradict the functions of the Supreme Council of Health and Food Security).

#### 6.1.2. Ministry of Health Headquarters-Level Responsibilities (Centralized Leadership and Intelligent Authority Delegation)

**A) Full establishment of the "National Health Crisis Operations Command Center" (ICS):** This headquarters is the thinking brain of operations, responsible for centralization in leadership and decentralization in execution. Its key duties include:

- **Integrated resource monitoring:** Online monitoring of bed, medication, equipment, and human resource inventory nationwide.
- **Intelligent resource allocation:** Deployment of personnel and equipment from low-risk areas to conflict zones based on precise needs assessment.
- **Operational protocol issuance:** Development and communication of clear, concise, and practical instructions instead of lengthy circulars.

**B) Development and communication of the "Command Succession Document":** Mandating all universities and hospitals to develop an official document identifying successors for all key responsibilities (from hospital director to ward head nurse) in advance. This document ensures that if any manager is removed, the command chain will not be interrupted.

#### 6.1.3. Universities and Medical Centers-Level Responsibilities (Frontline Command)

**A) Establishment of "Hospital Crisis Operations Command Center" (EOC):** The hospital director, as **Scene Commander**, by operating from this center, assumes complete responsibility for operations within their jurisdiction. This EOC, at the highest state of readiness and in wartime conditions, is recognized as the **health war room**, and all tactical and operational decisions are issued from this center.

**B) Use of delegated authorities for immediate action:** The Scene Commander (hospital director), based on legal approvals, has full authority for the following:

- **Modifying shift schedules and canceling leave** to ensure maximum presence of medical staff.
- **Changing the designated use of wards** (e.g., converting an internal medicine ward to a trauma ward) without requiring authorization.
- **Emergency procurement of vital items** from any available source, outside tender procedures.
- **Deploying volunteer forces** and defining job descriptions for them in the moment.

### Protocol 6.2: Emergency Financing and Establishment of Special Procurement Pathways

**Objective:** To ensure sustainable cash flow and eliminate bureaucratic obstacles in financial and procurement processes, in order to provide uninterrupted support for operations on the front lines.

#### 6.2.1. Government-Level Responsibilities (Creating Green Corridors for Finance and Procurement)

**A) Approval of the "Emergency Conditions Financial Regulations":** These regulations must be approved and communicated as law and include the following:

- **Exemption from the Public Accounts Act:** The Ministry of Health and its affiliated universities shall be exempt from tender procedures for procurement of all goods and services related to the crisis (medications, equipment, ambulances, support services).
- **Establishment of a special foreign exchange allocation pathway:** The Central Bank is obligated to create a **"foreign exchange green corridor"** so that the foreign exchange required for urgent import of medications and equipment is provided outside the regular queue and in less than **48 hours**.
- **Immediate customs clearance:** Creation of a **"special customs pathway"** for clearing health-focused shipments in less than **24 hours**, even on holidays.

**B) Sustainable and immediate financial resource provision:**

- **Authorization to withdraw from the National Development Fund:** Obtaining authorization from the Leadership for emergency withdrawal from the National Development Fund to cover unexpected war expenses.
- **Obligation of insurance organizations:** Insurance companies are obligated to pay **at least 80%** of hospital-submitted documents on account and in less than **15 days**.

#### 6.2.2. Ministry of Health Headquarters and Universities-Level Responsibilities (Optimal Resource Management and Authority Utilization)

**A) Formation of the "Emergency Resources and Expenditures Committee":** This committee at the university level is obligated to prioritize financial resources. Absolute priority goes to:

- **Payment of personnel salaries and benefits** to maintain motivation.
- **Procurement of vital medications and supplies** for treatment continuity.
- **Provision of support costs** (fuel, food).

**B) Implementation of emergency procurements:** Financial and procurement managers, using legally acquired authorities, proceed with immediate purchases and only document the process for post-crisis accountability.

**C) Increase in incentive payment ceilings:** Development of incentive guidelines to increase payments and overtime for personnel involved in operations, using legally acquired authorities.

**D) Settlement of expenses related to foreign nationals:** The Ministry of Health headquarters is obligated to coordinate with the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to devise a mechanism for financing health services provided during the crisis period to foreign nationals residing in or refugees entering the country as a result of the crisis, through government resources or international assistance (such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees), and communicate it in the form of a financial directive.

### Comprehensive Integration and Framework

This section ultimately creates an integrated three-level command system in which:

The strategic level (Supreme Council) is responsible for major national decisions and large resource allocation, the tactical level (Ministry of Health National Headquarters) performs operational coordination and information management, and the operational level (universities and hospitals) undertakes direct implementation and reporting.

The key to this system's success is two-way information flow: accurate and timely reports from bottom to top, and clear and executable directives from top to bottom. Additionally, agile financing ensures that decisions are transformed into practical actions with the necessary speed.

Table 6.1 presents a complete summary of responsibilities, while Diagram 6.1 illustrates the path of decision-making and information flow during crisis conditions.

**Table 6.1: Summary of Responsibilities in Command, Coordination, and Financial Affairs**

| **Area of Responsibility** | **Government Level** | **Ministry of Health Headquarters Level** | **Universities/Hospitals Level** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Command** | Formation of Supreme Council, national strategic decisions | Establishment of National EOC, macro operations management | Establishment of local EOC, field operations execution |
| **Coordination** | Cross-sectoral coordination among ministries | Coordination with military and relief agencies | Coordination with emergency services, fire department, and local governorate |
| **Financial Affairs** | Creation of national crisis fund, facilitation of laws | Fund management, credit distribution, petty cash allocation | Needs assessment, emergency spending, reporting |

Diagram 6.1: Decision-Making and Information Flow in Crisis illustrates a hierarchical four-tier command structure beginning at the top with the Supreme Health Council in Crisis (Strategic Level - Governmental, chaired by the First Vice President with key ministers as members) which issues strategic decisions that flow downward via solid command arrows to the National Health Crisis Operations Command Center (Tactical Level - Ministry of Health Headquarters, commanded by the Minister of Health with coordination of headquarters staff) responsible for issuing executive directives while simultaneously receiving operational, financial, and logistics inputs from supporting units; these executive directives then flow downward to the University Crisis Operations Command Center (Operational Level - Medical Sciences Universities, commanded by the University Chancellor and Dean of Medicine) which implements local deployment plans, and finally cascade to the Acute Event Commander (Field Level - Emergency and Trauma Centers, commanded by the Hospital Director and Department Head) who manages on-scene crisis response. Parallel to this downward command flow, a vertical reporting pathway (indicated by dashed arrows) carries programming, financial information, and operational reports upward from field level through each tier back to the strategic level, while dotted lines represent ICS (Incident Command System) lateral communications between units at similar levels, with the critical stipulation that all individuals in command positions must have clearly specified successors to ensure continuity of command authority during crisis conditions.

## Section Seven: Monitoring, Evaluation, and Continuous Improvement

**Section Introduction**

This section constitutes the vital completing cycle of the entire health system preparedness and response document. Without a precise monitoring system, regular evaluation, and continuous improvement based on lessons learned, even the best plans will lose their effectiveness over time and become incapable of facing emerging challenges.

The core philosophy of this section is based on **continuous learning from experience**. Every crisis, every drill, and every partial implementation of protocols provides a valuable opportunity to identify strengths, discover existing gaps, and improve future performance. This approach ensures that the health system is prepared not only for today's threats but also for future challenges.

### Explanation of Key Concepts for Managers

**1. The PDCA Cycle in Crisis Management:** This cycle includes four phases: **Plan, Do, Check, and Act**, which are continuously repeated. In crisis management, this cycle ensures that the experiences of every incident, drill, or even daily reporting become input for improving future performance.

**2. Organizational Learning Culture:** One of the biggest challenges for large organizations is resistance to change and the "everything is fine" syndrome. Creating a culture where reporting mistakes and weaknesses is not only not criticized but encouraged is essential for continuous improvement.

**3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Crisis:** Unlike normal conditions where performance indicators focus more on quality and satisfaction, in crisis situations indicators must focus on response speed, survival rate, resource utilization efficiency, and recovery time.

### Protocol 7.1: Continuous Monitoring and Surveillance

#### 7.1.1. Government-Level Responsibilities (Strategic Monitoring)

**Formation of the "Supreme Committee for National Preparedness Monitoring":** This committee, chaired by the Supreme Health Crisis Council (managed by the First Vice President) and including representatives of key ministries, is formed to monitor the proper implementation of all sections of this document.

**Key Duties:**

- **Annual national preparedness assessment:** Conducting comprehensive audits of the entire country's health system preparedness status and presenting reports to high-level state authorities.
- **Approval of national preparedness indicators:** Determining specific and measurable criteria for assessing the preparedness level of each province and university.
- **Performance-based crisis preparedness budgeting:** Allocating preparedness budgets based on evaluation results and the performance of each region.
- **Cross-sectoral coordination in monitoring:** Ensuring that all involved agencies (Defense, Interior, Intelligence) operate based on common standards.

**Creation of the "National Preparedness Monitoring System":** A digital platform that displays online the preparedness status of each province, university, hospital, and comprehensive or primary health center based on predefined indicators, enabling performance comparison and ranking.

#### 7.1.2. Ministry of Health Headquarters-Level Responsibilities (Tactical Monitoring)

**Launch of the "National Preparedness Control Room":** A continuous monitoring center for nationwide preparedness status that operates 24 hours and has the capability for real-time monitoring of preparedness status changes.

**Monitoring Tools:**

- **National Preparedness Dashboard:** Online display of strategic resource inventory status, equipment condition, personnel readiness, and reserve levels at all centers.
- **Early Warning System:** Automatic identification of concerning trends (such as sudden medication inventory depletion or increased personnel absence) and alert transmission to officials.
- **Dynamic Risk Map:** Interactive display of areas in critical preparedness status.

**Periodic Audit Program:**

- **Quarterly Audit:** Field inspection of 25% of the country's main universities and hospitals each quarter (such that the entire country is covered in one year).
- **Surprise Audit:** Conducting unannounced inspections of centers that have shown poor performance in previous evaluations.
- **Specialized Audit:** In-depth examination of specific areas (such as medication management, emergency surgery preparedness) at selected centers.

**Scoring and Ranking System:**

- Definition of a 100-point scoring system for each center based on specific criteria.
- Publication of lists of top-performing and weakest centers quarterly.
- Creation of reward and penalty systems based on performance.

#### 7.1.3. Universities and Medical Centers-Level Responsibilities (Operational Monitoring)

**Formation of the "Internal Preparedness Quality Committee":** At each university and hospital, a committee consisting of the Vice Chancellor for Treatment, Director of Nursing, Head of Emergency, Head of Equipment, and staff representative is formed.

**Committee Duties:**

- **Monthly self-assessment:** Detailed examination of the center's preparedness status based on standard checklists.
- **Remediation of identified deficiencies:** Prioritization and planning for resolving discovered problems.
- **Transparent reporting:** Sending accurate reports without concealment to the national headquarters.

**Daily Monitoring System:**

- **Daily Preparedness Checklist:** Daily review of critical items such as generator status, oxygen inventory, operating room readiness, and number of present personnel.
- **Red Status Report:** Immediate notification to national headquarters if preparedness falls below acceptable levels.
- **Accurate event recording:** Documentation of all problems, corrective actions, and resulting outcomes.

### Protocol 7.2: Performance Evaluation and Lessons Learned

One of the fundamental principles of modern crisis management is that **every event is a lesson for the future**. This principle has double importance especially in the health domain, which deals with human lives. The experience of various countries in facing major crises has shown that organizations capable of rapid and deep learning from their experiences have performed better in subsequent crises.

Performance evaluation in crisis management goes beyond simple report writing. This process must be designed not only to identify mistakes and shortcomings but also to provide deep understanding of **why** they occurred and **how** to prevent their recurrence in the future. Additionally, this process must also identify and strengthen strengths and successes so they can be repeated and reinforced in future events.

#### 72-Hour Post-Event Evaluation Process

International experience has shown that the best time to evaluate a crisis event is immediately after its conclusion, when details are still fresh in people's minds and emotions and experiences are vivid. However, immediate evaluation also has its risks, as it may be influenced by stress and fatigue from the event. For this reason, the 72-hour evaluation process is divided into three phases to provide a combination of urgency and accuracy.

##### Phase One - Raw Data Collection (Hours 0-24)

This phase focuses on speed and comprehensiveness. The goal is to record maximum possible information before details are forgotten or influenced by subsequent interpretations. In this phase, all individuals involved in the event are obligated to immediately after completing their shift provide a complete report of actions taken, decisions made, problems encountered, and observed results. These reports must be written based on a standard format and in plain language to enable comparison and analysis.

In addition to individual reports, in this phase all documentation related to the event, including device logs, CCTV camera footage, communication reports, completed forms, and any other document that can provide information about the event, is collected and archived. This phase requires precise organization, as individuals after a crisis event are usually tired and under stress and may not have sufficient motivation to complete reports.

##### Phase Two - Initial Analysis (Hours 24-48)

After 24 hours and achieving relative calm, the evaluation team begins detailed review and analysis of collected information. In this phase, the main objective is to identify patterns, trends, and turning points in the event's progression. Analysts must be able to prepare a precise timeline of events and determine where performance met expectations and where deviations occurred.

One useful tool in this phase is **Process Mapping**, which shows how information, resources, and decisions flowed during the event. This map helps identify bottlenecks, missing links, and improvement opportunities. Also in this phase, comparison of actual performance with predefined protocols is conducted to determine which protocol sections were properly implemented and which sections require revision.

##### Phase Three - Final Report Development and Action Plan (Hours 48-72)

In this phase, all findings and analyses are compiled into a comprehensive and understandable report. This report must not only provide a complete description of what happened but also propose specific and practical solutions for improving future performance. Each recommendation must have a specified responsible party, realistic timeline, and measurable criteria for assessing success.

#### In-Depth Performance Evaluation Methodology

##### Root Cause Analysis

Root cause analysis is one of the most powerful tools available for deep understanding of problems and failures. Unlike reviews that only address surface causes, this method seeks to discover fundamental root causes that, if not addressed, will cause similar problems to recur in the future.

The root cause analysis process begins by asking "why?" and continues until reaching the main controllable cause. For example, if in a crisis event oxygen supply for patients encountered problems, the analysis might proceed as follows:

**First Why**: Why was sufficient oxygen unavailable? Answer: Because backup cylinders were depleted.

**Second Why**: Why were backup cylinders depleted? Answer: Because the supply order was not placed on time.

**Third Why**: Why was the supply order not placed on time? Answer: Because the inventory monitoring system was not working.

**Fourth Why**: Why was the inventory monitoring system not working? Answer: Because the responsible employee had not received necessary training.

**Fifth Why**: Why had the responsible employee not received necessary training? Answer: Because a regular training program did not exist.

With this analysis, it becomes clear that the root cause of the problem is the absence of a regular training program, not the shortage of oxygen cylinders. Therefore, the main solution must focus on creating a regular training program.

##### Crisis SWOT Analysis

SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) is a well-known tool that also has extensive application in crisis management. However, applying this tool in crisis evaluation requires adaptation to the special nature of emergency conditions.

**Strengths** in this analysis include all factors that functioned well during the crisis. This can include outstanding individual performance, specific system efficiency, effectiveness of specific protocols, or even fortunate accidents that had positive results. Identifying these strengths is critical for reinforcing and institutionalizing them in the future.

**Weaknesses** include all aspects that did not perform satisfactorily. This may include training deficiencies, equipment shortages, communication weaknesses, organizational problems, or even physical building issues. It is important that these weaknesses be identified without bias and with the goal of improvement.

**Opportunities** in this context refer to lessons and capabilities that can be gained from the event. Every crisis is an opportunity for system improvement, teamwork strengthening, identification of hidden talents, and even garnering management support for necessary changes.

**Threats** include future risks and dangers that can be prepared for based on current experience. The current event may reveal vulnerabilities that could create bigger problems in future crises.

##### Organizational Learning System and Knowledge Sharing

One of the biggest challenges for large organizations, especially in the government sector, is that knowledge and experiences gained in one department or center are not transferred to other departments. As a result, each center must repeat the same mistakes and start from scratch. Creating an effective organizational learning system can solve this problem and ensure that one center's experience benefits the entire network.

**Crisis Experience Knowledge Bank:**

This information bank is far beyond a simple archive. It must be designed so users can easily search for information they need based on crisis type, severity, geographic region, or any other criterion. Also, this system must have the capability to analyze trends and patterns to make predictions about future crises.

The content of this information bank includes detailed event reports, summaries of lessons learned, documentary films and images, interviews with key individuals involved in events, and even simulations of important events. It is important that this information be written in plain and understandable language and provide different levels of detail for different audiences (managers, specialists, operational staff).

**Knowledge Sharing and Mutual Learning Program:**

Learning should not occur only through study. Direct interaction between people who have had similar experiences is one of the most effective methods of knowledge transfer. Holding regular "lessons learned" sessions where representatives from different centers share their experiences can provide valuable learning opportunities.

These sessions should not merely be reporting but should provide space for discussion and exchange of views. Participants must be able to ask their questions, relate their similar experiences, and even present their current challenges for consultation. This two-way interaction is not only useful for learning but also helps strengthen cooperation and solidarity among centers.

### Protocol 7.3: Continuous Improvement and Updates

The concept of Continuous Improvement is rooted in the Japanese management philosophy of "Kaizen," meaning "change for the better." This philosophy is based on the principle that one should never be satisfied with the current situation and should always seek ways to improve, even if these improvements are small and gradual. In health crisis management, this principle has special importance, as every small improvement can mean saving more human lives.

Continuous improvement in crisis management should not be merely reactive to problems that have occurred but should have a proactive and forward-looking approach. This means that even when everything is going well, one should seek improvement opportunities and prepare for future challenges.

#### Annual Review Cycle

One of the key tools for continuous improvement is the annual review cycle, which ensures that no experience is forgotten and all lessons learned are incorporated into future planning. This cycle must be designed to be both comprehensive and lead to practical actions.

##### Feedback Collection Phase (Months 1-3 of the year)

At the beginning of each year, all experiences, reports, complaints, suggestions, and observations from the previous year are collected and categorized. This work must go beyond simple compilation and include initial analysis of trends and patterns. For example, it may become apparent that specific problems recur in winter or that centers located in specific areas have common challenges.

In this phase, extensive surveys of all stakeholders are also conducted. This survey includes not only managers and medical staff but must also incorporate the opinions of patients, their families, partner organizations, and even media. The goal is to gain a comprehensive and multidimensional view of system performance.

Simultaneously with collecting internal feedback, study of environmental changes and new threats is also conducted. This includes review of technological developments, demographic changes, new disease patterns, emerging security threats, and experiences of other countries. The goal is to ensure that plans are prepared not only for today's challenges but also for probable future challenges.

##### Analysis and Design Phase (Months 4-6)

After collecting all information, the deep analysis phase begins. In this stage, expert teams conduct detailed review of findings and prioritize issues. This prioritization must be based on specific criteria such as hazard severity, probability of occurrence, cost of problem resolution, and impact on service quality.

For each priority issue, different solutions are examined and compared. This comparison considers not only technical aspects but also financial considerations, human resources, timing, and organizational acceptance. The result of this phase is a set of executable solutions with specific timelines and accurate cost estimates.

In this phase also, comprehensive review of long-term objectives and strategies is conducted. The previous year's experiences may show that some objectives were unrealistic or that priorities need to change. This strategic review ensures that plans are always aligned with environmental realities.

##### Implementation Phase (Months 7-9)

This phase is considered the core heart of the improvement process. All plans and ideas raised in previous phases are transformed into reality in this stage. The success of this phase depends heavily on precise planning, adequate resource allocation, and effective change management.

One of the main challenges in this phase is resistance to change. Humans naturally tend to work with familiar methods and avoid new changes. To overcome this resistance, it is necessary that staff not only receive training in new methods but also be convinced about the reasons and advantages of these changes.

Implementation must be done gradually and with continuous monitoring. Usually it is better to first implement changes in a pilot center and, after ensuring their success, expand to other centers. This approach reduces the risk of failure and provides the opportunity to correct problems before widespread implementation.

##### Evaluation and Consolidation Phase (Months 10-12)

At year's end, the time comes to evaluate the results of implemented changes. This evaluation must be based on measurable and predefined criteria. It is important that this evaluation be fair and impartial and recognize both successes and failures.

For changes that have been successful, a consolidation and institutionalization program is developed. This means that these changes become part of standard processes and are no longer considered an "experiment." To ensure continuity, changes may be needed in regulations, job descriptions, or information systems.

For changes that have not been successful, precise analysis of failure causes is conducted. The goal is to learn from this experience and prevent repetition of the same mistakes in the future. Sometimes, the failure of an idea is itself a valuable lesson that can prevent resource waste on wrong paths.

#### Innovative Mechanisms for Continuous Improvement

##### Staff Suggestion System and Universal Participation

One rich source of improvement ideas is staff who face operational challenges daily. These individuals often have the best understanding of the system's real problems and may propose simple and practical solutions that are unimaginable to managers. Creating an effective system for collecting and reviewing these suggestions can be a valuable source for improvement.

This system must be designed so that using it is simple and attractive. Staff must be able to easily submit their suggestions without fear of criticism or punishment. Also, there must be a transparent process for reviewing suggestions, and proposers must be informed of their suggestion's status.

To encourage participation, a significant reward system must be considered. These rewards can be not only financial but also include public recognition, job promotion, educational opportunities, or new responsibilities. It is important that rewards be fair and proportionate to the value of the suggestion.

##### Innovation Committee and Applied Research

In addition to staff's spontaneous suggestions, forming a specialized committee for research and development of innovative solutions is also necessary. This committee must consist of specialists from various fields who have the capacity to analyze complex challenges and provide creative solutions.

This committee should not only address current issues but also play the role of predicting future developments. Study of global trends, emerging technologies, experiences of other countries, and academic research is an important part of this committee's duties.

Collaboration with universities and research centers for conducting applied research projects is also very useful. These collaborations can both lead to finding scientific solutions for practical problems and improve staff technical knowledge.

##### International Experience Exchange Network

In the age of globalization, no country can face all challenges alone. Experience exchange with other countries, especially those that have had similar challenges, can be a valuable source of ideas and solutions.

This experience exchange can occur through various channels: membership in international organizations, participation in specialized conferences and seminars, establishing direct relationships with foreign counterparts, studying international articles and reports, and even using professional social networks.

It is important that this experience exchange not be one-way. Our country also has valuable experiences in crisis management that can be useful for other countries. This two-way exchange not only helps improve international relations but also enhances the country's scientific self-confidence and position.

### Section Seven Summary

Section Seven of this document, focusing on monitoring, evaluation, and continuous improvement, has described the vital completing cycle of the entire health system preparedness and response process. This section shows how through three levels of strategic, tactical, and operational monitoring, one can oversee proper protocol implementation and use lessons learned for continuous performance improvement.

The 72-hour post-event evaluation process provides a systematic method for transforming experiences into usable knowledge, while the annual review cycle ensures this knowledge is incorporated into future planning. The innovative mechanisms raised in this section, including the staff suggestion system and international experience exchange network, provide ways to strengthen organizational learning culture.

Table 7.1, presented below, provides a summary of the monitoring and evaluation matrix at four strategic, tactical, operational, and field levels, showing how each level with specific time periods and responsibilities contributes to completing the overall picture of system performance. Also, Diagram 7.1 visually displays the continuous improvement cycle and shows how the four phases of planning, implementation, review, and action are connected in a continuous cycle and lead to gradual but continuous system improvement.

**Table 7.1: Monitoring and Evaluation Matrix**

| **Monitoring Level** | **Process** | **Primary Responsible** | **Time Period** | **Key Output** |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Section Eight: Charter of Authorities, Legal Requirements, and Emergency Delegation in National Health Crises

**Strategic Introduction: Breaking the Chains of Bureaucracy to Save Lives**

In the battlefield against time to save human lives, the law must be **a protective shield for decisive managers**, not a frightening sword hanging over their heads. The experience of past crises in Iran and the world has shown that the greatest obstacle to rapid and effective response is not the lack of resources, but rather the paralysis of the decision-making system due to fear of administrative processes, restrictive laws, and post-crisis judicial responsibilities.

This section constitutes the legal backbone of the entire comprehensive preparedness and response document. Its objective is to create a **"special operational space"** in which necessary authorities are delegated in a transparent and hierarchical manner, and managers at all levels, with solid legal backing, are capable of making bold and immediate decisions. This charter is a roadmap for transitioning from **"inaction resulting from caution"** to **"decisive action based on authority"** and ensures that in golden moments, no opportunity to save lives will be lost due to legal gaps or ambiguities.

### Protocol 8.1: Strategic Authorities and Requirements at the Governance Level (Government and Three Branches of Power)

### Protocol 8.4: Mechanisms of Oversight, Immunity, and Accountability

**Objective:** Creating a balance between granting extensive authorities and ensuring their proper use, and more importantly, **establishing judicial immunity for bold and decisive managers.**

#### 8.4.1. Judicial and Executive Immunity

- **Principle of innocence in crisis decision-making:** Any decision made by managers at the three levels (from Minister to hospital president) within the framework of this document and with the aim of saving lives and controlling the crisis is **presumed to be in "good faith" and "necessity"** and the managers and executors of decisions are immune from any future judicial and administrative prosecution, unless **malicious intent, financial corruption, or personal gain** is conclusively proven. This immunity must be explicitly stated in the law approved by the heads of branches.

#### 8.4.2. Smart and Real-time Oversight

- **Supreme Operations Oversight Committee:** Formation of a committee consisting of representatives from the Office of Inspection of the Supreme Leader, the General Inspection Organization of the country, and the Court of Accounts, stationed at the National EOC and overseeing the **"process" and "compliance of decisions with the authorities of this document"** (not their technical content) in real-time. **Failure to declare a violation or manifest crime by this committee during operations (real-time oversight period) is considered confirmation of compliance of decisions with the framework of authorities and eliminates the possibility of post-crisis prosecution.**

#### 8.4.3. Accountability and Violation Penalties

- **Documentation for accountability:** All important financial and operational decisions must be recorded in summary and reasoned form (even in audio, text message, or handwritten form in the EOC logbook) so that post-crisis performance evaluation and accountability are possible.
- **Disruption of operations:** Any disobedience to commanders' orders, hoarding of health-focused items, or abuse of delegated authorities is considered **a war crime and an act against national security** and will be heard immediately and out of turn in military or special courts.

### Protocol 8.5: Mechanism for Payment of War Casualties' Expenses in Network Outage Conditions

- **Principle 1: Free treatment for casualties:** All services provided to war casualties at the point of service delivery are free.
- **Principle 2: Manual information recording:** Given the possibility of network outages such as Sepas, hospitals are obligated to establish a **minimal paper file** for each casualty including national ID code (if possible), type of injury, and main services provided. These forms are considered supporting documents.
- **Principle 3: Advance payment:** The government (through the **National Health Fund in Crisis** mentioned in Protocol 8.5) is obligated to pay a **weekly advance amount** per active bed in the emergency and crisis hospitalization departments to hospitals to maintain their liquidity.
- **Principle 4: Final settlement after crisis:** After normalization of conditions, expenses will be settled based on recorded paper documents and according to a **special crisis tariff** determined by the government, with final settlement with hospitals.

**Table 8.1: Matrix of Special Authority Delegation in Health System Emergency Conditions**

| **Area of Authority** | **Governance Level (Strategic Level)** | **Ministry of Health Headquarters (Tactical Level)** | **Universities and Medical Centers (Operational Level)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Financial Authority** | Budget allocation from National Development Fund and public resources; creation of currency green corridor. | National and international purchasing without limitation and credit transfer between universities. | Immediate local purchase (up to 5 billion tomans ceiling) and emergency revolving fund management. |
| **Resource Authority** | Deployment and temporary confiscation of all strategic national resources (industrial, logistical). | Taking control of all health system resources (governmental and private) at the national level. | Deployment of all medical and public centers within geographical jurisdiction. |
| **Personnel Authority** | General call-up and deployment of armed forces and Basij. | Relocation and distribution of all health system personnel nationwide. | Call-up of health-medical personnel (employed and retired) at the regional level. |

## Overall Summary and Conclusion

After traversing a comprehensive and detailed path through seven sections of this document, it is now time to summarize and present an overall picture of the roadmap drawn for the preparedness and response of the health system in crisis and war conditions. This document, beyond being a collection of technical guidelines, has presented **a comprehensive philosophy** for strategic thinking about crisis management.

**The Integrated and Systematic Nature of the Approach:**

What distinguishes this document from other crisis management guides is its systematic and integrated perspective. From the precise analysis of threat scenarios in the first section to the creation of a continuous improvement cycle in the seventh section, each element has been carefully coordinated with other elements and placed in service of the unified goal of "preserving citizens' lives in the most difficult conditions." This integration ensures that even if part of the system is damaged, other parts will be able to compensate and maintain overall functionality.

**Adaptation to Iranian Realities:**

This document has been designed taking into account the specific realities of Iran, including constraints arising from sanctions, geographical and climatic characteristics, existing administrative structure, organizational culture, and available resources. This adaptation has ensured that the proposed solutions, in addition to having a strong theoretical foundation, are also practically implementable and sustainable.

**Balance Between Preparedness and Operations:**

One of the fundamental challenges in crisis management is the balance between preparedness in peacetime and effective response during a crisis. This document has established this balance by providing precise protocols for both situations and creating mechanisms for rapid transition from normal to emergency status. Personnel know how to prepare in normal times and how to act during a crisis.

**The Human Element at the Center of Attention:**

Despite the emphasis on technology, equipment, and systems, this document has placed humans at the center of attention. From continuous training of personnel to maintaining their morale and motivation, from stress management to ensuring job security, all human aspects of crisis management have been addressed. This human-centered approach ensures that even in the most difficult conditions, personnel will have the necessary motivation and capacity to provide optimal services.

**Flexibility and Adaptability:**

This document, with awareness that the future is unpredictable and new threats may emerge, has emphasized flexibility and adaptability. The frameworks presented have been designed in such a way that they can adapt to different and even unexpected threats. This flexibility has been ensured through the creation of multiple response levels, definition of various scenarios, and establishment of continuous improvement mechanisms.

**Culture-Building and Institutionalization:**

The success of this document lies not only in its proper design but also in its implementation and institutionalization. The document, by emphasizing continuous training, periodic drills, creating a culture of participation and organizational learning, has provided a platform whereby these protocols move beyond being "instructions on paper" and become part of the organizational DNA.

### Final Message

This document is not an end, but rather a beginning for a long and continuous path toward improving the preparedness of the health system. Every manager, every expert, and every employee who deals with this document is responsible not only for implementing its guidelines but also for maintaining, improving, and transferring it to the next generation.

In a world where threats are becoming increasingly complex day by day, only systems that have learned how to learn quickly, adapt quickly, and improve quickly can survive. This document has provided a roadmap for such a system. Now the time has come for this roadmap to move from theory to reality.

**"Today's preparedness, tomorrow's peace of mind"** - This sentence encapsulates the overall philosophy of this document. It is hoped that this document will never be tested in war conditions, but preparedness for such a test will always be maintained.
