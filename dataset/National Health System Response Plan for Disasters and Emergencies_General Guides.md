## Types of Functions


**The types of functions intended by this EOP**
- A function is the main activity that must be performed in each phase of disaster management.
- In this EOP, the functions of the preparedness and response phases are presented. A successful response is predicated on appropriate preparedness.
- The response phase functions are divided into three groups: 1) Managerial functions, 2) Specific functions, and 3) Specialized functions. Specialized functions are in fact the components of service delivery within a specific function (each specific function can have one or more specialized functions).
- An appendix is provided for each function, presenting the following:
    1) Function code and name
    2) Name of the responsible unit and collaborating units
    3) Description of the function
    4) Description of the duties of the responsible unit and collaborating units
    5) Implementation guidelines


## Types and Stages of Developing a Disaster and Emergency Response Plan

**Table Title:** Developing Disaster and Emergency Response Plans: Time Phase, Preliminaries, Definitions, and Review Sequence

| Time Phase | Action | Definition | Review Sequence |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Before the Incident** | **Hazard and Safety Assessment** | Determines and prioritizes the frequency of hazard occurrence and its level of risk and safety for each community. | Annually |
| | **Developing the Strategic Response Plan or EOP** | States the principles, policies, and guidelines for response operations. | Annually |
| **After the Incident** | **Damage and Needs Assessment** | After an incident occurs, it determines the extent and scope of damage, needs, and available resources. | Begins as soon as news of the incident and the extent of damage is received. The incident command decides on repeating the assessment based on the type of hazard, extent of damage, and changes in the affected area. |
| | **Developing the Incident Action Plan or IAP** | Addresses how to operationalize the EOP in a specific affected area. An IAP is developed for each incident. | Reviewed hourly or daily depending on successive damage and needs assessment reports. The start and end time of the IAP is equivalent to the duration of the response operation. The duration of the response is determined by the incident command at the relevant level. |


**Types and Stages of Developing a Disaster and Emergency Response Plan**
Disaster and emergency response plans are divided into two types: strategic and operational. These two terms are conventionally considered equivalent to Emergency Operations Plan/EOP and Incident Action Plan/IAP, respectively. In some sources, the term Emergency Response Plan/ERP is used instead of EOP. The prerequisite for developing an EOP is a hazard assessment, and the prerequisite for developing an IAP (which is done based on the principles presented in the EOP) is a damage and needs assessment of the area affected by an incident. The table below shows the sequence, definitions, and characteristics of the above items:



## Base Scenario


**Base Scenario
Introduction**
As its name suggests, the base scenario is for planning with an "all-hazards and all-health aspects" approach. Due to the existence of numerous hazards and diverse consequences, this type of scenario gives each planning team, especially at the local level, the necessary flexibility to adapt the scenario to its own conditions. In this base scenario, the most common hazards in the country are emphasized based on available information.

### The criterion for including topics in the base scenario is to provide the minimum information that leads to the initiation of important functions of the response phase. The general structure of this scenario includes 1) a description of the hypothetical region, 2) a description of the hazards, and 3) a general description of the resulting damages. It is obvious that each province, county, or health center can change parts of the scenario according to local conditions.

### **Geographical Description of the Region**
The region in question is a hypothetical hub where two of its provinces are simultaneously affected by different hazards. One of these provinces is a border province.

### **Description of Hazards**
An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale shook two adjacent counties, A and B, in provinces 1 and 2 at 5 a.m. Following the earthquake, a landslide occurred in county A, and the dam on the river between counties A and C cracked, leading to a flood in county C. County B has a nuclear power plant that could be damaged. A gas station in county B was damaged and resulted in an explosion. A tanker carrying chlorine gas was also derailed and exploded due to the earthquake. There is evidence of harassment by criminals in the form of kidnapping and theft in county B. County B has recently passed a cholera epidemic and is at the peak of an influenza epidemic, but the provinces of the hub are experiencing it. County B is also facing a severe dust storm.

### **Damages Caused by Hazards**
As a result of the earthquake in counties A and B combined, at least more than a thousand people were killed, more than 3,000 people were injured, and 40,000 people in urban and rural areas were affected. In county C, 20 people were killed, 60 people were injured, and 10,000 people were affected by the flood. The landslide caused no casualties but led to the destruction of health centers built on steep slopes. The consequences of nuclear radiation are unknown, but patients with suspicious symptoms are referring to medical centers.

One hospital in county A is completely destroyed, and one hospital in county B is 30% destroyed. 20 health houses, 10 rural health centers, and 5 urban health centers have been completely destroyed. Several health personnel have also died. There is a possibility of damage to the vaccine stockpile.

Local people have rushed to help the injured and are helping with excitement. Survivors are crying next to the bodies of their loved ones and wailing. Rescuers are moved by seeing these scenes and are engaged in providing services with all their might. Blockage of communication routes is a serious obstacle to providing relief services and transferring the injured. County A has an airport that allows only a limited number of flights due to repairs. In county B, it is not possible for airplanes to fly due to the dust storm. Mobile and fixed telephone lines in some areas are out of order, electricity in some areas is cut off, and the drinking water network is damaged.

The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) has been activated at the hub, provincial (in the governor's office, universities of medical sciences), and Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education levels, and has sent assessment teams to the region. Designated counties and provinces have announced their readiness to help, and international organizations have also volunteered to help.

Despite responding with full force, the injured need to receive primary medical services and be transferred to medical centers and hospitals.

Many injured people remain in the affected areas, which necessitates the establishment of field hospitals.

Emergency shelter has begun in some places, but most people prefer to stay near their homes. Rescuers are trying to distribute water, food, and create sanitation facilities.

In some urban and rural health centers and health houses, several personnel have been severely injured. Damage to the vaccination chain, structural destruction, falling and breaking of supplies and equipment, and power outages have made it impossible to continue providing primary health care. The elderly, patients with non-communicable and specific diseases are facing problems in receiving services.

A wave of injured people is flocking to health centers and hospitals in the affected and neighboring counties. The companions of the injured are also worriedly trying to get reassurance about the condition of their patients. Hospitals are trying to transfer some of the referred injured to other hospitals. In one of the hospitals, a large number of building's glass panes are broken. A report of a strong gas smell has been given from the surgery department, which subsequently led to a fire and injured a number of personnel. There is also a possibility of the fire spreading to other parts of the hospital. One of the hospital departments needs to be evacuated. Hospital officials on the one hand have to attend to the injured, on the other hand, they are worried about the theft of equipment and supplies, and on the other hand, they are thinking about how to compensate for the costs.

Most people in the neighboring cities and villages are scared and are asking whether there will be an aftershock or not. The radio and television are broadcasting educational messages. The need for various types of information is expressed by the people and officials.


## Principles of Response Operations

The operational principles of this EOP are:
1) Crisis Management Structure
2) Incident Command System
3) Declaration and Termination of Emergency Conditions
4) Incident Leveling

### **1) Crisis Management Structure**
- This EOP is operationalized within the framework of the Health in Emergencies Working Group (based in the Disaster and Emergency Management Center of medical universities) and its specialized committees and through the EOC. The specialized committees of the working group include Health, Treatment, Support, Education, and Research. The members of each specialized committee are the heads of the centers/offices of the relevant deputy in the university or ministry. It is obvious that the response operations are carried out by the two areas of health and treatment.
- In the Deputy for Health, the responsibility for coordination is with the Office of Disaster Risk Reduction and Management, which is responsible for the working group's committee. This unit coordinates the activities related to the health EOP in coordination with the working group's secretariat on the one hand and the centers and offices of the Deputy for Health on the other hand.
- All health and treatment units in the country are obliged to form a crisis management committee (the directive for forming the crisis management committee of hospitals and health units has been communicated by the treatment and health deputies of the ministry). The intended health and treatment units are: hospital, emergency base, provincial health center, county health center, urban health center, rural health center, urban-rural health center, health post, and health house. Operations at the level of each health and treatment unit are carried out by the unit's personnel. If necessary, health liaisons and health volunteer forces are also used.
- Maximum coordination with all working groups of the National Disaster Management Organization, the Civil Defense Organization, military, law enforcement, and security forces in planning and implementing response operations is mandatory.
- The use of the capacity of the private, charitable, and non-governmental sectors, with prior planning and observance of regulations, is strongly recommended.
- The geographical division of crisis management is presented in the figure below. The counties of a province act as designated counties for each other. The universities of each of the 9 crisis management hubs act as designated universities in each hub.

- An Incident Command Post (ICP) must be established in each affected area. Each ICP is in contact with a higher-level EOC. Depending on the extent of the incident, one or more ICPs may be formed. The geographical scope and commander of each ICP are determined by the higher-level EOC. The EOC has the task of strategic and tactical coordination, and the ICP is responsible for operational management. The figure below shows a schematic view of the relationship between the EOC and ICP at different geographical levels.

### **2) Incident Command System**
- To create coordination and prevent the overlap of duties and functions, it is necessary that all operational units provide services under a unified command. To achieve this goal, a uniform command structure is needed in all units. The incident command system is the same system defined by the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education or the University of Medical Sciences. This system is part of the country's command system. It is based on the following general model.
- All headquarters and health and treatment units are obliged to form and officially announce this system at their own level. These systems are part of the university's overall incident command system and operate in coordination with it.
- The commander of operations at the university level is the president of the university, at the county level is the head of the health and treatment network, and at the level of the health and treatment unit is the head of the unit.
- Depending on the conditions and type of incident, the university or county commander appoints the deputy for treatment as their successor, and the second successor, the deputy for health, takes responsibility.
- The commander of treatment operations is the deputy for treatment, and their successor is the director of treatment.
- The commander of health operations is the deputy for health, and their successor is the head of the office of disaster and risk management.
- In the health and treatment unit, the commander of operations is the head of the unit, and their successor is the coordinator of the unit's crisis management committee.
- In the event of an incident, the commander of operations or their successor is obliged to activate the incident command system at their own level.
- One person can be responsible for more than one position, given the small number of personnel in each center.
- A similar incident command chart for the center exists at the county and provincial health center headquarters. In the event of a disaster, each position will be in contact and interaction with its counterpart.

### **3) Declaration and Termination of Emergency Conditions**
- The authority for determining the declaration and termination of emergency conditions is the EOC of the ministry, hub, or university (depending on the extent of the incident). However, in some cases, the first warning or declaration of conditions may be made by peripheral units such as a health and treatment center or a hospital. An example of this is a flash flood where in some areas, the time interval between rainfall and the flood is only a few minutes. The occurrence of a landslide is another example. In this case, the center or hospital in question is informed of the incident sooner than the university EOC and must activate its own incident command system.
- If for any reason the declaration of emergency conditions is not made by the higher level and the service delivery units of the county are informed of or faced with the incident, the relevant unit is obliged to report the news immediately to the higher level EOC. It is obvious that taking vital actions at the unit level, such as activating the incident command system, evacuation, calling forces, and providing services, must be done simultaneously.
- The declaration of the start and end of emergency conditions in each service delivery unit is the responsibility of the commander of operations of that unit.

### **4) Incident Leveling**
The authority for determining the incident level, declaring emergency conditions, and terminating them is the EOC of the university (hub or country, depending on the extent of the incident).

| Incident Level | Definition |
| :---: | :--- |
| $\text{E}_0$ | Normal conditions |
| $\text{E}_1$ | The extent of the incident is at the level of one or more health and treatment units, but county assistance is not required. |
| $\text{E}_2$ | The extent of the incident is at the level of one county, and university assistance is not required. |
| $\text{E}_3$ | The extent of the incident is at the level of one university of medical sciences (more than one county is involved, or for any reason university assistance is necessary). |
| $\text{E}_4$ | The extent of the incident is at the level of one hub (more than one university is involved, or for any reason assistance from other universities in the hub is necessary). |
| $\text{E}_5$ | The extent of the incident is at the national level (more than one hub is involved, or for any reason national-level intervention is necessary). |
| $\text{E}_6$ | International assistance is required. |


## Preparedness Phase Functions

#### **Preparedness Phase Functions**
Preparedness functions are actions that are taken in the preparedness phase for detailed planning and effective response operations. These functions are listed in the table below. Note that the function of public education is also one of the duties of the health system (within the framework of the public education working group), but in this section, the emphasis is on the preparedness of the health system itself.

```
Preparedness Functions for Disaster Response
Note: The reason for choosing the letter P is to recall the word Preparedness.
```

| Appendix | Function Title |
| :---: | :--- |
| $\text{P}_1$ | Strategic Coordination with Stakeholders |
| $\text{P}_2$ | Safety and Hazard Assessment |
| $\text{P}_3$ | EOP Development |
| $\text{P}_4$ | Stockpiling of Supplies and Equipment |
| $\text{P}_5$ | Personnel Training |
| $\text{p}_6$ | Personnel Drill |

#### **Description of Function:**
When the implementation of a program requires the presence and participation of more than one person, the issue of coordination arises. "Coordination" is the opposite of "self-coordination". A clear example of coordination is the performance of an orchestra where all musicians follow a single instruction to pursue a common goal, which is the successful and beautiful performance of the music. The amount of applause from the audience is an indicator of their skill and coordination. In disaster management, the responsible organization is the orchestra conductor, and the collaborating and supporting organizations are the group of musicians. The satisfaction of the affected people is also equivalent to the applause of the audience.

Coordination is divided into two groups, strategic and operational, and each has both intra-sectoral and inter-sectoral relevance. Operational coordination will be very difficult without strategic coordination. Refer to Implementation Guideline 1, the matrix of types of coordination and the tools for their realization.

All units of the health system require intra-sectoral and inter-sectoral strategic coordination. The responsibility for implementing this function lies with the Health in Emergencies Working Group and its specialized committees. This must be done with the active participation of all operational units.

The mechanism for strategic coordination is the joint development of the EOP and the signing of a memorandum of understanding for cooperation in the preparedness phase. The working group and its specialized committees are obliged to prepare a list of topics and organizations with which coordination and the conclusion of a memorandum of understanding should be done, and to take action in that regard. This work must be done with the participation of the units responsible for general and specific functions. Of course, it is obvious that the implementation of this function is very difficult in some cases and depends on the structure and mechanisms of the country's disaster management organization.

#### Appendix P2: Application of Safety and Hazard Assessment

```
Responsible Unit: Health in Emergencies Working Group and its specialized committees
Collaborating Units: All units of the Ministry of Health / University
```

##### **Description of Function:**
In a hazard assessment, the hazards that threaten a community, system, or center are identified, their probability of occurrence and the amount of resulting damage are estimated. The amount of damage is proportional to the severity of the hazard, the level of vulnerability, and the preparedness of the community or service delivery system. Hazard prioritization can determine the priority of actions. In a hazard assessment, scenarios of hazard occurrence and related damages are usually developed so that planning is done with a vision of conditions close to reality.

All headquarters and health and treatment units in the country are obliged to conduct the hazard assessment program annually in October and report the results to the higher level. To receive the hazard assessment files for hospitals and the network system, refer to Implementation Guideline 1.

##### Duties of the Responsible Unit:
1) Conducting an annual hazard assessment of health and treatment facilities
2) Collecting and analyzing hazard assessment data
3) Preparing and presenting the hazard assessment report

##### Duties of the Collaborating Unit:
1) Participation in conducting an annual hazard assessment of health and treatment facilities
2) Participation in collecting and analyzing hazard assessment data
3) Participation in preparing and presenting the hazard assessment report

##### **Description of Function:**
The target group for this function is managers and staff. Training is an important strategy for improving the knowledge and skills of managers and staff to enhance disaster management processes. All managers and staff in the field of disaster management must be well trained on the various components of this EOP. Adopting an appropriate training methodology is essential to ensure the effectiveness of the training. The evaluation of participants should be done in such a way as to ensure that they have acquired sufficient knowledge and skills. Therefore, the issuance of a certificate should not be solely conditional on participation in the training program.

Implementation Guideline 1 shows the type and level of training that each target group should receive. In this guideline:
- The level of training is divided into two groups: basic and specialized. Basic training deals with the fundamentals of disaster management, and specialized training deals with the technical details of disaster management and specific and specialized functions.
- Senior managers include ministerial directors general and above, presidents and vice presidents of universities of medical sciences and above.
- Middle managers include managers other than those mentioned in the definition of senior managers, and heads and deputies of health and treatment networks.
- All staff, in addition to their own area of expertise, must receive basic training on the specific functions of other areas. This is necessary for coordinated response operations.
- The staff of each specialized unit receives comprehensive training on their own specific and specialized functions.

Each of the managers and staff of the health system must have a crisis management training record. You can see a sample of this record in Implementation Guideline 2.


##### **Duties of the Responsible Unit:**
- Developing a disaster management training matrix in such a way that it specifies which level of managers and staff should be trained for which subject.
- Developing a training schedule
- Evaluating the effectiveness of the training
- Preparing an annual report

##### Duties of the Collaborating Units:

Collaborating Units: All units of the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education (University of Medical Sciences)
```

##### **Description of Function:**
This function is the first step in starting the response operation. After receiving news from peripheral sources, the media, and other organizations, the EOC verifies the news. The verified news is immediately communicated to activate the ICS.

The occurrence of weather and climate-related hazards can be warned. The warning levels are determined by responsible organizations such as the meteorological organization. However, some of these cases are difficult to translate into operational concepts in the health system. Foreshocks can also be considered as a warning. Implementation Guideline 1 shows how warning levels can be operationalized. In hazards like earthquakes, rapid information about the exact location, magnitude, and depth can help responsible organizations in developing the IAP in the initial moments.

##### Duties of the Responsible Unit:
1) Receiving news 24/7 from hazard monitoring centers
2) Analyzing and verifying news from hazard monitoring centers and the higher-level EOC
3) Announcing the news and warning level to collaborating units and operational teams
4) Recording lessons learned in the relevant form

##### Duties of the Collaborating Units:
1) Continuous communication with the EOC for information exchange
2) Receiving news verification and warning level from the EOC
3) Taking action based on the functions defined in the EOP
4) Recording lessons learned in the relevant form


**Implementation Guideline 1 - Warning Levels**

| Warning Level (Color) | Warning Level (Title) | Definition | Expected Actions |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Yellow** | **Advisory** | The possibility of hazard occurrence exists but its probability is low. | Advisory and warning status to operational teams. |
| **Orange** | **Standby** | The possibility of hazard occurrence exists and its probability is high. | Activating the incident command system (command and planning). |
| **Red** | **Action** | The hazard has occurred or its occurrence is certain. | Activating the incident command system (operations) and implementing the response operation functions. |
| **White** | **All Clear** | The probability of hazard occurrence has been eliminated. | Announcing a return to normal conditions if the hazard has not occurred. Announcing the start of the recovery phase if the hazard has occurred and the immediate response operation has ended. |

#### Appendix M3: Joint Rapid Assessment

```
Responsible Unit: Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
Collaborating Units: All units of the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education (University of Medical Sciences)
```

###### **Description of Function:**
This function is the first action after verifying the news of an incident and calling up personnel. Its purpose is to confirm the occurrence of the incident and investigate the damages and needs. It is a teamwork, and the information obtained from the rapid assessment is used in developing the IAP. The purpose of conducting a joint rapid assessment is to save time and resources. Each specialized unit can subsequently conduct its own specialized assessment if needed.

The hazard assessment team includes experienced individuals from at least the following units: pre-hospital emergency, diseases, environmental health, and nutrition. In selecting the rapid assessment team, the following factors should be considered: experience and knowledge of crisis management, especially rapid assessment, as well as the physical ability to endure difficult conditions. Each team member must be equipped with a crisis backpack. A laptop, a digital camera, and a GPS should be considered for each team.

The time for conducting a rapid assessment is the first possible time for the relevant team to be present in the affected area. This time should not be more than 24 hours after the incident. The repetition of the rapid assessment and its time sequence are determined by the incident commander according to the incident conditions.

The assessment team can obtain the necessary initial information from the available resources in their own unit and the EOC, as well as from peripheral forces, before being present in the area. The peripheral forces must be trained on the information they should provide to the assessment team in the preparedness stage. The output of each assessment is the Situation Report form, or SitRep.

###### Duties of the Responsible Unit:
1) Coordination for sending the rapid assessment team to the area
2) Receiving the rapid assessment report from the relevant team
3) Analyzing the rapid assessment report and converting it into an Incident Action Plan (IAP)

###### Duties of the Collaborating Units:
1) Coordination for sending the unit's representative to the affected area
2) Participation in analyzing the rapid assessment report to develop the IAP

###### **Duties of the Assessment Team:**
1) Reviewing existing information and maps before deployment
2) Being present in the affected area as soon as possible
3) Conducting the assessment through observation, interviews with key individuals and survivors, and review of available documents

Implementation Guidelines for the Rapid Assessment Function
Implementation Guideline 1 - Situation Report Form (SitRep)


The accuracy of the information in this form depends on the following: prior preparedness for information collection, the time elapsed since the incident, and the availability of information at the time of completing the form. It is obvious that as time passes from the moment the incident starts, the information will gradually become more complete. With this in mind, record the most accurate available information in each report. Please record the details for each question.

Note: In the rows related to health and treatment actions and needs, the information should be provided by unit, including hospital, pre-hospital emergency, communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, environmental health, family health, nutrition, mental health, health education, network development, and laboratory. This form can be used for all centers/offices, and its compilation is done by the EOC.

**Description of Function:**
The rapid assessment information must be updated regularly. The time sequence of periodic assessments is determined by the incident command. In large incidents, it is recommended to conduct the assessment daily for up to a week. After that, the time interval can be increased. This depends on the changes in the affected environment. The output of periodic assessments should also be presented in the form of a Situation Report (SitRep). Of course, in some cases, a survey needs to be designed in consultation with an epidemiologist.

During the response phase, it is necessary to conduct surveys as well. These surveys are conducted based on random sampling from the affected population with the aim of assessing needs, determining the status and health indicators, and evaluating actions. It is necessary to consult with epidemiology experts and health experts to design these surveys.

To make the right decision in disasters, timely and correct information is needed. Due to the special situation during disasters, the routine information exchange system will not have the necessary efficiency, and it is necessary to plan for communication platforms and develop the relevant forms before the event. Establishing a comprehensive information system that includes all different levels, including the operational units that collect or produce data and the headquarters units that analyze the information, will be very helpful in this regard. The use of GIS technology.

#### Appendix M5: Establishment of the Incident Command Post (ICP)

```
Responsible Unit: Pre-hospital Emergency and Environmental Health
Collaborating Units: All operational units
```

##### **Description of Function:**
Each affected area must have an Incident Command Post or ICP that operates under the supervision of the relevant EOC. The location for establishing the ICP can be a container, a tent, or a safe building in the area. In selecting the ICP location, attention should be paid to the hazards of earthquake, flood, landslide, and security considerations. The purpose of forming this post is to create a comfortable and safe place for the work and meetings of the operational teams. Let's not forget that the well-being, safety, and security of the operational teams have priority over providing services to the population.

```
The equipment required for the ICP, which should be prepared in the preparedness phase, are:
- Office supplies (desk, chair, stationery, etc.)
- Telephone (landline, mobile, and satellite)
- A laptop
- A fax machine
- Internet connection equipment
- Rest space and supplies for men and women (field beds, etc.)
- Field toilet
- Field shower
- Water and food stockpile
```

##### Duties of the Responsible Unit:
1) Preparing supplies and equipment for the ICP in the preparedness phase
2) Setting up the ICP in the affected area as soon as possible
3) Providing support services to the team stationed at the ICP

##### **Duties of the Collaborating Units:**
1) Participation in preparing supplies and equipment for the ICP in the preparedness phase
2) Participation in setting up the ICP in the affected area as soon as possible


#### Appendix M6: Development of the Incident Action Plan (IAP)

```
Responsible Unit: Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
Collaborating Units: All units of the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education (University of Medical Sciences)
``` 
##### **Description of Function:**
**Necessity of developing the IAP:** The EOP addresses the principles, policies, and guidelines, and its operational principles and function appendices are applicable in all incidents. However, this plan is developed in the preparedness phase, i.e., before the incident occurs. In this plan, base or common scenarios can be considered, but it is not possible to predict all possible scenarios. The number of these scenarios is countless. For a better visualization, calculate the number of possible scenarios based on the following formula:

```
Number of types of hazards × Number of provinces × Number of cities × Number of villages × Amount of damage × Level of preparedness × Amount of available resources ×...
```

Pay attention to the following examples:
1) An earthquake that has led to the destruction of 50% of one city and 100% of three villages in province A.
2) An earthquake that has led to the destruction of 10% of one city and 50% of three villages in the same province A.
3) The occurrence of scenario 1 or 2 in province B, whose capacities and resources are different from province A.

You can give many other scenarios as examples. It is obvious that the incident management in each of the above scenarios is different, although the management principles are the same.

**Definition and specifications of the IAP:** The IAP is a dynamic written document in which the objectives of the incident response management and the necessary tactics to achieve the objectives are stated and are reviewed depending on the changes in the needs and resources of the operational field. The IAP states what action should be taken by whom and when to respond to an incident. The type of action in the IAP is determined based on the functions specified in the EOP and considering its principles. The specifications of the IAP are as follows:
- Development time: The time for developing the IAP is as soon as the first situation report is received from the affected area.
- Time period: The time period of the IAP is equivalent to the duration of the response operation. The duration of the response operation is determined by the incident command.


The IAP should be reviewed depending on the changes in the affected area (in terms of new damage and available resources). The review sequence is determined by the incident commander.
- Level of development: The IAP is at the determined level of the incident, for example, national, regional, provincial, county, and local.
- Responsibility for development: The responsibility for developing the IAP is with the Planning section of the incident command system, which must be approved by the incident commander. The development of the IAP is a participatory process and is done with the presence of all relevant operational units.
- Location of plan development: A suitable location for developing the IAP is the EOC.
- Number of IAPs in each incident: Each incident has only one IAP. However, it is necessary for each geographical-functional unit to have its own IAP, which is in fact part of the joint IAP of the incident, which is called the field plan or IAP in this guideline. Implementation Guideline 1 shows this concept. The geographical-functional unit refers to the unit providing a function in an operational geographical area that is specified in the plan. For example: the environmental health management unit in county A.

##### Duties of the Responsible Unit:
1) Developing the IAP based on the EOP and the results of the damage and needs assessment
2) Communicating the IAP to all operational units
3) Monitoring the implementation of the communicated IAP and its revision according to the operational conditions

##### Duties of the Collaborating Units:
1) Participation in developing the IAP based on the results of the damage and needs assessment according to the unit's responsibility
2) Implementing the IAP
3) Monitoring the implementation of the IAP related to the unit and its revision according to the operational conditions



IAP Development and Operationalization Stages - Implementation Guideline 1

| Order | Stage | Explanation |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 | **Situation Awareness** | The necessary information for situation awareness is obtained from the results of the rapid assessment. Continuous situation awareness must be done based on the time period determined by the incident commander. In many incidents, the conditions of the affected area change, so it is necessary to repeat the assessment and revise the IAP accordingly. |
| 2 | **Formation of the Plan Development Team** | The plan is developed by the planning section of the Incident Command System (ICS), under the guidance of the incident command and with the participation of all planning representatives of the geographical-functional units. The location for developing the joint plan is the EOC. |
| 3 | **Development of Operation Objectives** | The objectives must be determined depending on the special conditions of the incident. For more explanation, refer to the relevant topic below. |
| 4 | **Plan Development** | Based on the defined objectives, in this stage, it is determined what action should be taken, by which person or group, and at what time, for each objective in each geographical-functional unit. For more explanation, refer to the IAP development table below. |
| 5 | **Plan Approval and Communication** | The approval and communication of the plan are done by the incident command. |
| 6 | **Plan Dissemination** | The plan must be made available to the relevant officials and all operational teams. |
| 7 | **Plan Implementation** | It is done by the operational teams. |
| 8 | **Continuous Plan Revision** | Based on the results obtained from the continuous assessments in the affected area, it is necessary to revise and communicate the objectives and components of the IAP. Holding coordination meetings is an effective action for this purpose. |


**Implementation Guideline 2 - Guideline for Determining and Writing Objectives in the IAP**
Pay attention to the following points in determining the objectives:
- Based on the information and priorities obtained from the rapid assessment, the IAP development team must determine its objectives.
- The objectives are determined based on the damages, needs, available resources, and the social and political conditions governing the incident.
- To ensure that no objective is missed, determine the relevant objectives for each response phase function (general, specific, and specialized).
- The objectives must be clear, in operational language, measurable, and achievable.
- In response operations, information becomes more accurate over time. Consequently, the objectives will also become gradually more accurate.
- The objectives state the main action, its location, and time of implementation. The method of implementation and the responsible person/group are not stated in it.
- For each function, the relevant objectives are determined separately.
- To achieve one objective, one or more activities may be defined.
- A few examples of the objectives of an IAP:
    - Sending two health rapid response teams to county A by date ...
    - Establishing a disease surveillance system in villages A, B, and C by date ...
    - Sending a disease outbreak investigation team to village A by date ...
    - Chlorinating the water source spring of village A by date ....
    - Evacuating the injured from section A of the affected county B by hour ....
    - Installing 10 educational announcements in the affected area A by date ....
    - Distributing 3 satellite mobile phones in counties A, B, and C by date ....
    - Establishing a field hospital in county A by date ....
    - .....

**Implementation Guideline 3 - IAP Development Table**
Use the following table to develop the IAP. Note that for each function, the relevant objectives are determined separately. To achieve one objective, one or more activities may be defined.


#### Appendix M7: Coordination

```
Responsible Unit: Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
Collaborating Units: All units
```

##### **Description of Function:**
The response operation is carried out in conditions where specialized units must perform their assigned tasks in a short time, under difficult physical and stressful conditions. In addition, the nature of many activities requires several units to do that work together. This requires coordination mechanisms. Weakness or lack of these mechanisms leads to low-quality and costly implementation of the response operation (in terms of time and resource consumption). The final result is the dissatisfaction of the affected population.

"Coordination" is the opposite of "self-coordination". A clear example of coordination is the performance of an orchestra where all musicians follow a single instruction to pursue a common goal, which is the successful and beautiful performance of the music. The amount of applause from the audience is an indicator of their skill and coordination. In disaster management, the responsible organization is the orchestra conductor, and the collaborating and supporting organizations are the group of musicians. The satisfaction of the affected people is also equivalent to the applause of the audience. Coordination does not happen by itself but requires prerequisites and mechanisms that are listed in Implementation Guideline 1. The responsibility for ensuring effective and timely coordination is with the incident command at the relevant level.

##### Duties of the Responsible Unit:
1) Conducting intra-sectoral and inter-sectoral strategic coordination in the preparedness phase (refer to function P1)
2) Deploying the ICS
3) Jointly developing and revising the IAP
4) Creating a comprehensive and joint information management system
5) Timely sharing of information through the development of consecutive situation reports (SitRep)
6) Holding daily coordination meetings

##### **Duties of the Collaborating Unit:**
1) Participation in deploying the ICS
2) Participation in jointly developing and revising the IAP
3) Participation in creating a comprehensive and joint information management system
4) Timely sharing of information
5) Participation in holding daily coordination meetings

#### Appendix M9: Support and Continuity of Service Delivery

```
Responsible Unit: Pre-hospital Emergency, Network Management Center (in each health and treatment unit, the support section of the incident command system is responsible for this)
Collaborating Units: All units of the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education (University of Medical Sciences)
```

##### **Description of Function:**
The characteristic of a disaster-prepared health and treatment center is that it maintains its ability to provide services after an incident occurs. This requires taking damage reduction measures before the incident and having a rapid and efficient support system after the incident occurs. In disasters, a successful operation is impossible without an efficient support system. Support in disasters is a highly specialized field and requires extensive training and practice. A serious challenge facing the health system is relying on normal condition mechanisms in crisis operations. The support processes in normal conditions are usually very slow and involve a long administrative process. A rapid and effective disaster response operation can never be achieved in this way. It is essential that all processes and technical specifications of the required support items be standardized in the preparedness stage. It is also essential that the stockpiling of the required items be done in the preparedness phase.

It is necessary to form a specialized support team in each university of medical sciences and its affiliated counties, and its members should be trained and drilled. The components of this function are:
1) Providing a safe and comfortable service delivery space
2) Providing supplies and equipment for service delivery
3) Safe and comfortable accommodation for operational teams in the field (accommodation, water and food, heating and cooling equipment, toilets, and showers)
4) Providing electricity
5) Providing transportation for personnel and equipment
6) Providing telephone, fax, and internet communication means
7) Providing an emergency fund
8) Requesting, purchasing, and tracking required supplies and equipment

##### Duties of the Responsible Unit:
1) Providing support supplies in the eight components in the preparedness phase
2) Training and drilling the specialized support team
3) Providing support services in the eight components during the response phase
4) Preparing and presenting the support function report

##### **Duties of the Collaborating Units:**
1) Participation in providing support supplies in the eight components in the preparedness phase
2) Participation in training and drilling the specialized support team

#### Appendix M10: Communications

```
Responsible Unit: Pre-hospital Emergency and Environmental Health
Collaborating Units: All units of the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education (University of Medical Sciences)
```

##### **Description of Function:**
One of the common problems in disasters is the lack of proper communication between operational units. Damage to communication infrastructure, along with the large increase in the volume of data required to be exchanged in a short time, adds to the importance of planning for establishing communication between units during disasters. Establishing communication between operational units with each other and operational units with the EOC is a prerequisite for a rapid and effective response operation.

##### Duties of the Responsible Unit:
1) Examining the existing communication platforms between operational units
2) Preparing a multi-layered communication plan between units
3) Preparing a communication protocol between units
4) Preparing the required supplies and equipment
5) Assessing the communication status at the time of the incident
6) Determining how to establish communication between units
7) Continuous monitoring of the quality of communications during the response
8) Evaluating the communication plan after the response operation and improving it

##### Duties of the Collaborating Units:
1) Participation in examining the existing situation and preparing a communication plan for disasters
2) Training personnel on the prepared communication protocol
3) Providing feedback on communications during a disaster

#### Appendix M11: Personnel Safety

```
Responsible Unit: Senior Safety Officer of the Incident Command System
Collaborating Units: All units of the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education (University of Medical Sciences)
```
##### **Duties of the Operational Teams:**
1) Checking communication devices
2) Checking the communication status with the command center and the direct supervisor at the announced time intervals
3) Using the code system designated for emergency situations

##### **Description of Function:**
Paying attention to the safety of personnel while performing operations is one of the important issues in disaster planning. Unfortunately, in carrying out the duties of the units in normal conditions, although the safety of personnel has always been emphasized, in most units, observing safety points is only left to the operational personnel themselves, and usually no independent unit is considered for this function. Since supervisory actions for most threatening issues in the environment, such as hazardous materials, are carried out by the health unit, it is recommended that this unit take responsibility for the safety management of the operation, and in cases such as medical issues that are not in the expertise of the experts of this unit, help be sought from other units such as pre-hospital emergency. This function is also applicable to natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, and the like, and personnel should be kept safe from them.

##### Duties of the Responsible Unit:
1) Inspecting the incident site for the presence of hazardous materials or conditions or natural hazards
2) Contacting other organizations responsible for safety, such as the fire department and the Red Crescent Society, to check the safety status of the incident site
3) Determining the boundaries of the hot and warm zones with the help of other organizations (Implementation Guideline 1)
4) Determining the minimum personal protective equipment for personnel entering the hot zone (Implementation Guideline 2)
5) Supervising the proper implementation of safety instructions by personnel
6) Ensuring the presence of dedicated treatment teams for injured personnel at the site
7) Supervising the working hours of operational personnel
8) Sending a report to the operations commander



##### Duties of the Collaborating Units:
1) Participation in preparing safety equipment and supplies in the preparedness stage
2) Participation in inspecting the safety of the incident site

##### **Duties of the Operational Teams:**
1) Sending information on the safety status of the incident site to the senior safety officer
2) Using the minimum personal protective equipment announced by the senior safety officer


Incident Site Zoning – Implementation Guideline 1**
To control contamination and determine access levels in chemical and radiological incidents, the incident area is usually divided into three zones (figure below):
- Hot Zone: From the incident site to a distance where there is no longer a risk of primary contamination. Entry into this zone is only allowed for trained personnel with appropriate personal protective equipment.
- Warm Zone: The decontamination zone that is around the hot zone, and a corridor for decontamination is created in it. Although there is no chance of primary contamination in this zone, due to the possibility of secondary contamination, entry into this zone is also only allowed for trained teams with personal protective equipment.
- Cold Zone: The support and deployment zone for operational teams, and there is no risk of contamination in it. All operational personnel and injured persons must be decontaminated before entering this zone.
Although a national standard for zoning has not been established, the following points can be helpful:
- The responsibility for zoning is with the rescue and relief forces, such as the fire department, but if it is not possible to access these teams, the safety officer of the health team must determine the boundaries of the hot and warm zones.
- Entry and exit to the hot and warm zones are done against the wind direction.
- The boundaries of the zone depend on the type of material and the conditions of the area. But in general, in some sources, the total of the hot and warm zones has been announced as 300 meters.




Levels of Personal Protective Equipment – Implementation Guideline 2

| Level | Description | Positives | Negatives |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | **Fully encapsulated suit with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)** | Highest level of protection for contact with equipment and hazardous materials that are transmitted through inhalation. | High cost, training, and maintenance have limited the use of this level to specialized hazardous materials teams. It has limitations in movement, causes sweating, and has a limited usage time. |
| **B** | **Suit with impermeable seams with SCBA or supplied-air respirator** | A high level of protection is used in unknown environments. It gives the user more mobility than level A. | It depends on a supplied-air respirator or a limited air cylinder and has a high cost. It has limitations in movement, causes sweating, and has a limited usage time. |
| **C** | **Protective suit against hazardous material spills with an air-purifying respirator** | It gives high mobility to the user, has fewer heat stress problems, and has a shorter training time. | It has a lower cost and a shorter training time. |
| **D** | **Work clothes with normal protections such as gloves and goggles** | Very high mobility with minimal heat stress for the user. Lower cost and training time. | Work clothes with normal protections do not protect against chemicals and many hazardous materials. |

2) Participation in crowd control in the relevant unit
3) Informing the physical protection unit in case of observing a suspicious person


#### Appendix M13: Evacuation of a Health and Treatment Unit
```
Responsible Unit: Evacuation Officer in the Incident Command System of the Health and Treatment Unit
Collaborating Units: All units of the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education (University of Medical Sciences)
```

##### **Description of Function:**
In most hazards (such as fire, explosion, flood, earthquake, release of hazardous materials, and civil unrest), it is possible that all or part of the health-treatment and/or headquarters centers will be evacuated. This evacuation can include personnel and clients. To safely and effectively exit a large number of people, it is necessary to prepare and practice the center's evacuation plan in advance.

##### Duties of the Responsible Unit:
1) Preparing the evacuation plan in the center (Implementation Guideline 1)
2) Installing evacuation signs and emergency exit routes in all places of the building
3) Installing visual and audible signs to announce the emergency situation to all personnel and clients
4) Preparing a list of hazards that require the evacuation of the center
5) Appointing an evacuation officer to guide personnel and clients out of the safe route for each building in each work shift
6) Announcing the emergency situation for evacuation
7) Determining a safe assembly point near the building for personnel and clients
8) Training all personnel and conducting an evacuation plan drill

##### Duties of the Collaborating Units:
1) Cooperation in preparing the evacuation plan
2) Participation in preparing emergency exit maps
3) Participation in training programs and drills

**Implementation Guideline 1 - Important Points in Preparing an Evacuation Plan**
Like any plan, it is first necessary to conduct a hazard assessment to prepare a list of the center's important hazards. The following points will be helpful in preparing the plan:
- A list of hazards that may necessitate the evacuation of the building based on its vulnerability should be prepared.
- A detailed map of the building should be prepared, and safe exit routes should be identified in consultation with the technical section.
- Based on the prepared map, an emergency exit map should be prepared for all places in the building and installed in a suitable place, such as behind doors.
- Emergency exit routes should be marked with signs in all corridors and stairs.
- The arrangement of equipment in all rooms and corridors should be such that it causes the least disturbance to evacuation.
- If possible, more than one route should be identified for each point so that if one of the routes is blocked, an alternative can be used.
- The location of emergency equipment during evacuation, such as first aid kits and firefighting equipment, should be marked on the map.
- A system for announcing the emergency situation, including audible and visual signs, should be installed in the center.
- A safe place for assembly should be considered near the center.
- In each shift, for each building, a trained person should be designated to manage the evacuation and guide others.
- The prepared plan should be taught to all personnel annually and updated in practical drills.
- In the event of earthquake tremors, the first action is to take shelter in a safe place. After the tremors have stopped, count to 20 and then evacuate the building.
- In the event of an earthquake, if you are "near" the exit door of the building that opens to the yard, you can exit the building.
- Help the clients of the center/hospital during evacuation.
- During evacuation, help people with disabilities, the elderly, children, and pregnant women. Every disabled, chronically ill, or pregnant person should have a trained caregiver to help them during evacuation.

#### Appendix M14: Public Information

```
Responsible Unit: Senior Public Relations Officer of the Incident Command System, with the opinion of the commander
Collaborating Units: Public relations unit in cooperation with the office of education and health promotion and all units of the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education (University of Medical Sciences)
```

##### **Description of Function:**
Risk communication to the public and personnel is an important pillar of crisis management. On the one hand, the dissemination of news of incidents and potential dangers should not be in a way that causes panic and fear among the public and personnel, and on the other hand, the restriction of news dissemination should not lead to the public's lack of awareness of potential dangers and the exposure of more people to them. Accordingly, it is necessary to prepare a public information plan for the effective collection of information, analysis, and summary, and the appropriate dissemination of news through the media.

##### Duties of the Responsible Unit:
1) Taking the necessary measures to receive timely news from all units before the incident
2) Preparing a list of mass media for news dissemination and ways to communicate with them before the incident
3) Activating the university/center's news site for information dissemination before the incident
4) Preparing general recommendations for probable hazards before the incident
5) Consolidating and analyzing the news
6) Preparing the text of the news in coordination with the operations commander
7) Determining the interviewee according to the importance of the news and the required expertise
8) Coordinating interviews and disseminating news
9) Monitoring the news in local and national media

##### Duties of the Collaborating Units:
1) Sending information related to incidents and potential dangers to the public relations unit
2) Participation in consolidating and analyzing information and preparing the text of the news
3) Introducing a suitable representative for an interview if needed
4) Participation in monitoring the news related to the unit
5) Evaluating the information dissemination carried out

##### **Duties of the Operational Teams:**
1) Participation in sending news to the relevant unit and public relations
2) Referring reporters at the scene to the public relations unit and, if interviewed, refraining from announcing statistics and figures and analysis


**Implementation Guideline 1 - Interviewing Guide**
Interviewing requires specialized knowledge and sufficient experience. Due to the importance of disseminating news in disasters, it is necessary to identify in advance in the response plan the individuals who have received sufficient training in this field and have sufficient experience. The following points are helpful for conducting an interview:
- Most of the media's questions can be anticipated in advance, and the answers can be prepared in mind or on paper. (For example, information about the dimensions of the crisis (number of dead, injured, affected or homeless population, volume of relief operations, the most current need that can be solved with public participation, the type of public aid needed, the number of relief teams, and recommendations for the public))
- The appearance of the interviewee should be neat and professional. If the university's operational teams use uniforms or vests, it is recommended that the interviewee also use them according to their expertise during the interview.
- An interview at the incident site while the operational teams are providing services, especially in the acute phase of the response, can give the audience the assurance that the response operation is being carried out with maximum capacity.
- It is better to pause to give a good answer than to be flustered and give a bad interview.
- If you do not know the answer to a question, postpone the answer to another time until you receive sufficient information.
- Try to provide the information you have, especially about the response operation.
- Speak honestly. If there was a serious problem in providing service, accept it but assure that the entire capacity of the university has been used to help.
- If the incident has resulted in heavy casualties and damages, or if there are shortcomings in the response operation, do not deny it and express sympathy with the affected people at the beginning of the speech.
- Start the important information that you want to be well disseminated with emphatic phrases such as "The most important news is that...".
- The text of the interview should not be long and full of statistics. Good news is stated in simple terms for the public. This information can include the nature of the incident and the actions people should take to protect themselves.
- At the end of the interview, while providing the necessary recommendations, thank the reporters.

#### Appendix M15: Performance Monitoring and Evaluation

```
Responsible Unit: Health in Emergencies Working Group and its specialized committees
Collaborating Units: All units of the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical Education (University of Medical Sciences)
```
##### **Description of Function:**
Monitoring and evaluating the performance of each agency or center to review the actions taken and correct the plans is an important post-incident action. If this function is not performed and documented well, there is a possibility that mistakes and errors will be repeated. For evaluation, the objectives, job descriptions, and standards must be determined in advance so that after the implementation of the response operation in an incident or drill, the extent to which the objectives have been achieved and the accuracy of the operation in implementing the job descriptions and standards can be determined. The existing EOP is a suitable basis for preparing checklists for evaluating general, specific, and specialized functions.

##### Duties of the Responsible Unit:
1) Supervising the preparation of response plans (such as EOP), including objectives, job descriptions, and standards, by all units
2) Collecting daily reports from all units
3) Comparing the actions taken with the functions required for the incident
4) Conducting field visits to complete the review of actions in the required sequences
5) Collecting each unit's evaluation of its own specialized functions in the operation
6) Summarizing the results of the review and presenting them to the deputy for health and all units
7) Improving the existing plans based on the evaluation results

## Pre-hospital Emergency Operations

### Introduction
**Situation Description**
Since this plan has been prepared as a general and comprehensive framework at the national level, it is obvious that after its communication, it is necessary to develop the relevant response operation plan at the university and county levels based on the present model and framework, according to the local conditions and the results obtained from the latest hazard analysis of the same region. This regional plan has been prepared with an "all-hazards" approach, including both natural and man-made hazards. Of course, in each region, according to the probability of the occurrence of specific hazards, it is necessary to add a "special appendix" for each hazard to the local plan.
- It is recommended that, using the tools communicated by the secretariat of the Health and Treatment in Emergencies Working Group, the extraction of hazards, vulnerabilities, and capacities, and finally the hazard analysis in the area covered by the university be carried out, and the probable and base scenarios be extracted.
Considering that the main consequence of most hazards is the death and injury of a number of people present in the affected area, and the damage to infrastructure and physical spaces and their destruction causes normal health and treatment services to be unavailable or inaccessible; the presence of pre-hospital emergency services is not only vital in the acute phase of the response, but also in the continuation of the response operation and also in the recovery phase, it is necessary to provide services more extensively than in normal conditions.
In most universities of medical sciences and health and treatment services, the pre-hospital emergency department is part of the Disaster and Emergency Medical Center and includes the communication center (dispatch), the treatment affairs guidance and information headquarters, the crisis operations guidance center, and the emergency bases. At the time of an incident, the first and most experienced emergency personnel are responsible for the operations unit at the scene.

### Appendix S-1.1: Pre-hospital Rapid Assessment

```
Responsible Unit: Pre-hospital Emergency Operations (115)
Collaborating Units: University Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
```
#### **Description of Function**
A rapid assessment of the incident area is conducted with the aim of determining or estimating the extent and/or cessation of the incident, the number of injured, and the required resources and facilities. In this action, which is carried out immediately after the occurrence of a disaster, in addition to determining the characteristics of the incident, the equipment, human resources, actions, and other needs that must be responded to appropriately and immediately are also identified. In a rapid assessment, the information is mostly general and estimated. A rapid assessment is usually carried out by sending pre-hospital emergency operational units to the incident scene, but this information may be received through any of the units or personnel under the health system and even other relief organizations.
Note: With the aim of estimating the required resources, the dispatch is able to conduct a rapid assessment in two ways: one, by sending the closest team to the incident site, and the other, by repeated contact with the people present at the scene.

#### **Duties of the Responsible Unit**
- Determining the exact geographical location, time, type, and extent of the incident and predicting the end time
- Requesting a rapid assessment by the closest operational unit (the first ambulance, in addition to the rapid assessment, takes command of the incident until a senior scientific or executive authority arrives).
- Dispatching a motorlance, ambulance, or emergency helicopter from the closest operational unit to the incident site
- Estimating the required equipment and manpower
- Receiving information through an interview with the scene commander
- Receiving information regarding the safety of the scene
- Obtaining information from other sources (through the crisis operations guidance center)
- Completing the checklist and recording the actions taken
- Informing the officials and completing the forms based on the information received, starting the call-up process based on the initial assessment


#### **Duties of the Collaborating Unit**
- Exchanging important information collected for assessing the incident situation
- Providing the necessary facilities and equipment, including communication and transportation means
- Exchanging information of collaborating organizations with the communication center (dispatch)
- Sending the requests of the pre-hospital emergency to the collaborating organizations and following up on receiving the needs
- Coordinating for ensuring the safety and security of the scene, conducting search and rescue, firefighting, handling of bodies, managing hazardous materials, facilitating traffic flow, and commanding the scene

### Appendix S-1.2: Dispatch of Pre-hospital Operational Teams
```
Responsible Unit: Communication Center (Dispatch) of the Disaster and Emergency Medical Center (Emergency 115)
Collaborating Units: University Crisis Operations Guidance Center
```
#### **Description of Function**
One of the important functions of the pre-hospital emergency communication center in incidents and disasters is to respond quickly and in a timely manner to requests for help, guide and lead ambulances and relief vehicles to the scene, and coordinate the transfer of the injured to hospitals. These functions are carried out by the emergency communication center (dispatch) using number 115 and usually with the employment of physicians (as consultants and directors of medical affairs) and with the presence of nursing and emergency medical personnel (as call takers) under the supervision of a person as the shift supervisor.
Proper management of the pre-hospital service delivery system and correct telephone triage will cause the closest ambulances to be present at the patient's bedside in sufficient numbers, in the shortest possible time, and with the required information. This process is very important, especially at the time of incidents and disasters when the request for an ambulance from the affected and people present at the scene reaches its maximum.

#### **Duties of the Responsible Unit**
- Answering the phone calls of those seeking help and receiving and recording their condition and necessary information (maximum 1 minute per call)
- Reviewing the intervention guidelines appropriate to the type of incident
- Consultation by the physician stationed at the communication center with the communication center experts (EMD) and also the technicians present at the scene if needed
- Deciding on dispatching or not dispatching ambulances and determining the number and type of ambulances needed according to the rapid assessment report
- Announcing the necessary information regarding the type and extent of the incident to the dispatched teams
- Continuous guidance and direction of ambulances and other operational teams according to the available information from the crisis operations guidance center
- Recording the time of call-up, dispatch, arrival at the scene, dispatch to the hospital, and end of missions
- Continuous communication with the crisis operations guidance unit and providing a report to that unit
- Continuous communication with the personnel designated as commanders at the incident scene and exchanging information
- Recording the mission information and the injured and the actions taken by the teams
- Preparing a report of the actions taken

#### **Duties of the Collaborating Unit**
- Making the necessary coordinations with other units and organizations
- Collecting information from health and treatment centers
- Coordinating with the police to facilitate traffic flow and establish security
- Making the information of the treatment affairs guidance and information headquarters available to the communication center (dispatch) and vice versa


**Implementation Guideline 1 - Telephone Triage Process**
- It is done based on the national triage guideline communicated by the Disaster and Emergency Medical Center of the Ministry of Health.

**Implementation Guideline 2 - Conditions for a Communication Unit Expert**
- It is done based on the guideline communicated by the Disaster and Emergency Medical Center of the Ministry of Health.



### Appendix S-1.3: Scene Command
```
Responsible Unit: Pre-hospital Emergency Operations Unit (115)
Collaborating Units: Fire Department and Safety Services, Police Force (both traffic police and preventive police), Disaster Management Organization, Atomic Energy Organization, Oil Refining and Distribution Company, private ambulances, etc.
```

#### **Description of Function**
In incidents with mass casualties (such as severe road accidents) and also in disasters (such as floods, earthquakes, fires, etc.), the first operational unit that arrives at the incident scene will be responsible for commanding and controlling the scene until the operations commander or a technician with more experience arrives at the scene and takes over the command of the operation. In this type of incident, it is necessary for one person to take command of the scene to establish the required areas, observe safety principles, and communicate with other relief organizations. This person is responsible for supervising the best possible implementation of the operation and the full performance of duties by all units involved in the operation.

#### **Duties of the Responsible Unit**
- Active communication with the communication center or dispatch
- Active communication with the forces present at the scene (triage officer and transfer officer)
- Active communication with the organizations present at the scene (Red Crescent Society, Fire Department, Police Force, Armed Forces Medical Services, etc.)
- Determining a suitable location for the incident command post, determining the triage areas, casualty collection points, and staging area at the incident site, advanced aid area, and if necessary, announcing the need for a mobile hospital, etc.
- Proper distribution of existing forces in the created areas
- Supervising the performance of the pre-hospital operational teams present at the scene
- Continuous communication with the communication center (dispatch)
- Monitoring and evaluating the performance of the operations unit and providing a report to the incident commander

#### Duties of Collaborating and Support Units
- Establishing safety and security of the scene
- Exchanging information regarding the incident situation and the actions being taken
- In chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive incidents, identifying the hot, warm, and cold zones
- Controlling the movement of people to the incident area
- Providing expert opinion on personal protective equipment for being present at the incident site
- Making personal protective equipment available to emergency operational personnel
- Cooperation in establishing medical areas at the scene, such as the casualty collection point, triage area, and advanced aid area
- Making the necessary resources (personnel, equipment, and supplies) available for providing emergency medical services at the scene


Implementation Guideline 1 - Incident Scene Organization**
In mass casualty incidents and also in disasters, the pre-hospital emergency system, in addition to transferring the injured, needs to take action to establish the following areas depending on the type of incident, the number of injured, the distance to the nearest medical center, and the available resources.

**Incident Command Post (ICP)**
This center is a vehicle or a place where the operations commanders of all organizations present at the scene, such as the emergency services, fire department, Red Crescent, military and police forces, and other organizations, gather together to exercise "unified command" at the scene while exchanging information. It is better for the incident command post to be located in the closest and safest place to the incident site.
Note: According to the law, the responsibility for establishing the incident command post lies with the Disaster Management Organization.

**2 Casualty Collection Point**
Since most of the injured are scattered at the site, it is necessary to identify one (or more) areas for collecting the injured. This area should be as safe and as close as possible to the incident site with easy access to air support, ambulance bus, and light ambulance, so that the search and rescue personnel bring the injured to this area. Of course, determining the collection point can prevent the unnecessary dispatch of injured who do not need specialized medical action and also the transfer of patients without coordination. To mark this area, one or more ambulances can be stationed around the site, or any other sign can be used.

**3 Triage Area**
In some incidents and disasters, the collection point and the triage area cannot be separated, but in special incidents (such as a plane crash), it is necessary to evacuate the injured from the high-risk area as quickly as possible; therefore, they are transferred to a point near the incident site so that other actions can be taken. The triage of the injured should start from the very first moment. It is better to have separate places in this area for immediate (red), delayed (yellow), non-emergency (green), and deceased (black) injured, and medical personnel such as doctors and nurses should be present in each area. Of course, it is clear that the concentration of medical personnel in the red and then yellow areas will be greater. A doctor or one of the experienced emergency nurses as the "triage officer" will be responsible for triage.

**Advanced Medical Post (AMP)**
Considering that in mass casualty incidents and disasters, the number of injured is greater than the capacity of ambulances for their transfer, or the centers do not have the capacity to admit all the injured, the time for the injured to reach specialized medical centers will be long; therefore, to perform life-saving medical actions, it is necessary to establish an advanced medical post near the incident site. The advanced medical post can be set up using a tent, or any other suitable structure, or local capacities. If there is not enough time to send a structure or set it up, depending on the weather conditions, one or more ambulances are placed next to each other, and with the help of the equipment in the ambulances and their technicians, the advanced medical post is established. Before entering the advanced medical post, the injured are prioritized based on the four-level START triage. It is better for the injured in the advanced medical post to be triaged under SAVE, with the approach that the most actions are taken for the injured who will benefit the most. This area is the deployment site for Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs).

**Evacuation or Transportation Unit**
Simultaneously with triage and providing emergency medical services and stabilizing the injured, it is necessary to form an evacuation unit in the area to organize the transfer. In this area, which is located in the safest area near the advanced medical post or the collection point, all the ambulances dispatched to the area are stationed so that after being organized and initially checked by the triage officer, they are dispatched to the incident area.
Note 1: This unit can be combined with the staging area.
Note 2: The person in charge of this area is the "transfer officer", who must distribute the injured by being aware of the admission status and available specialties in the hospitals and the distance of the medical centers to the incident site, and in prior coordination with the treatment affairs guidance and information headquarters and the triage officer.
**Staging Area**
According to incident management standards, it is necessary to establish a staging area near the incident area and in a safe place, and a person who is responsible for scene support should take command of it. All facilities, equipment, and resources sent to the incident area must first be stationed in the staging area so that after the necessary checks and based on the need, they are sent to the incident site. Establishing a staging area, especially in incidents where the relief time is more than an hour, prevents the congestion of resources in the incident area.

1-2- Advance Medical Post Simple Triage And Rapid Treatment (START)
3-4- Secondary Assessment of Victim Endpoint Disaster Medical Assistance Teams
5-6- Evacuation / Transportation Unit Staging Area


The person in charge of the staging area, in continuous communication with the person in charge of operations, while being informed of the forces and equipment sent to the area, reports the existing needs. If the dimensions of the incident are very large and other university units are also present at the site, depending on the type of incident, a person from the university's operational personnel will be in charge of the staging area.

**Mobile Hospital**
In some incidents, in addition to the advanced medical post, it is necessary to set up a mobile hospital near the incident site and in a safe and secure location with a suitable access route. Cases where it is better for the operations commander to think about setting up a mobile hospital include the complete destruction or unusability of local hospitals along with a high number of injured, and the possibility of a long relief operation. Although a national standard for a mobile hospital has not yet been defined, it is necessary to have this hospital ready to provide services at the site in the shortest possible time in the mentioned cases. Of course, it should be noted that although a mobile hospital is one of the necessities of pre-hospital services, setting up a mobile hospital is not one of the duties of the pre-hospital emergency field, and it is necessary that this duty be specifically considered in the operational plan of the Disaster and Emergency Medical Center (which will be prepared and communicated in the future).

### Appendix S-1.4: Provision of Pre-hospital Treatment Services
```
Responsible Unit: Pre-hospital Emergency Operations Unit
Collaborating Units: University Deputy for Treatment
```

#### **Description of Function**
At the time of incidents with a large number of injured, the emergency operational units, after being present at the scene, while prioritizing the injured, start providing emergency medical services based on the triage priority. These actions include emergency medical services that are necessary to preserve the life of the injured or prevent further injury. After that, the injured are transferred to hospitals and medical centers based on priority and the capacities of the hospitals, and during the transfer, their condition is checked and emergency medical services are provided. The injured who are transferred by the pre-hospital emergency system should be transferred to the most appropriate and preferably the nearest suitable medical center in coordination with the dispatch.

#### **Duties of the Responsible Unit**
- Coordination for entering the incident scene with the organizations responsible for safety and security, such as the fire department, police force, etc.
- Creating the required areas at the scene, including the command post, collection or triage area, advanced aid post, and transfer unit.
- Triage of the injured based on the communicated protocol and determining the priority/color of the injured using a standard triage tag (and other methods if not available).
- Performing life-saving medical actions based on the protocol in the advanced medical post.
- Effective communication with the injured, explaining the existing situation and the actions taken for them if possible.
- Proper stabilization of the injured with available equipment.

Implementation Guideline 1 - Triage**
Triage is actually a system for categorizing patients based on their physical condition to determine the priority of performing medical actions and/or transfer to medical centers. This system will essentially determine which individuals need immediate care to save their lives and which injured individuals will survive despite a delay in receiving emergency medical care. This system also identifies the injured who are likely to not survive even if medical action is taken for them. The goal of triage in incidents and disasters is actually to be able to provide the maximum emergency services with minimum facilities, in the minimum possible time, to the majority of the injured. Performing correct and timely triage at the incident scene has a direct effect on other aspects of performance. Primary triage at the incident scene (if the safety and security of the incident site are confirmed by the fire department and/or police forces) can be performed by the pre-hospital emergency forces.
For more information regarding the triage process in mass casualty incidents, refer to the book "Pre-hospital Medical Emergencies".


Implementation Guideline 2 - Triage Tag**
The national triage tag for incidents and disasters in the pre-hospital field has been prepared.

### Appendix S-1.5: Scene Command

```
Responsible Unit: Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
Collaborating Units: Treatment Affairs Guidance and Information Headquarters, Communication Center (Dispatch) of Emergency 115, parallel Crisis Operations Guidance Centers in other organizations or hubs
```

#### **Description of Function**
Crisis operations guidance includes any action taken to increase coordination in the management of incidents and disasters and to establish the necessary communications with intra-organizational units at all upstream, parallel, and downstream levels, as well as other organizations, in order to increase the speed of response to incidents and disasters and to document experiences. Many of the job descriptions of the crisis operations guidance center are mentioned in the operational principles section. The job description of this unit in all stages of incident and disaster management has been developed based on the experiences of past incidents such as the Bam earthquake and has been made available to the universities through the National Crisis Operations Guidance Center.
Note: At the time of an incident, the university's incident command system is stationed in the crisis operations guidance center and takes command of the incident. At the same time, the main function of the crisis operations guidance center is coordination between different units and organizations.

#### Duties of the Responsible Unit
- Continuous communication with hazard monitoring centers
- Announcing the initial warning
- Implementing the existing guidelines and protocols based on the type of incident
- Coordination in sending the rapid assessment team
- Communicating the "Incident Action Plan" to other sections based on the rapid assessment and the order of the operations commander
- Intra-organizational and inter-organizational information dissemination based on the type and level of the incident
- Announcing standby to the relevant units
- Establishing active communication with all levels of incident command
- Supervising the proper organization of the incident scene
- Supervising the proper distribution of the injured among the hospitals based on their existing capacities

### Appendix S-1.6: Distribution of the Injured

```
Responsible Unit: Treatment Affairs Guidance and Information Headquarters (MCMC)
Collaborating Units: Communication Center (Dispatch) of Emergency 115, Crisis Operations Guidance Centers, all units of the Deputy for Treatment, all hospitals
```

#### **Description of Function**
Due to the large number of injured and the limited capacity of hospitals, as well as the changes that occur in the number and type of injured treatable in hospitals, it is necessary for a center to dynamically be in contact with all affiliated hospitals, both public, private, etc., on the one hand, and with the command post and the transfer officer at the scene and also the emergency communication center (dispatch) on the other hand, so that the distribution of the injured is managed in a balanced way and based on the momentary capacity of the destination hospitals. In addition, by guiding the ambulances, the possibility of several ambulances entering one hospital at the same time is created. This center operates in most universities under the title of treatment guidance headquarters. In other words, this headquarters, at the time of incidents and disasters, is part of the crisis operations guidance center that has continuous contact with the hospitals, and while announcing standby and timely information dissemination to the hospitals regarding the incident, which leads to increased preparedness in response to the incident, it also informs the relevant official of the needs and other problems of the hospitals for admitting patients and the proper distribution of the injured, which leads to coordination between the pre-hospital emergency system and the hospitals in these centers and prevents the waste of resources and the need for subsequent transfer between hospitals, and reduces the time of providing medical services to the injured. In the best conditions, this headquarters and the crisis operations guidance center are located adjacent to each other and are in active communication with each other.

#### **Duties of the Responsible Unit**
- Continuous communication with the crisis operations guidance center
- Announcing the initial warning and standby to all medical centers and hospitals
- Dynamic information dissemination to the crisis operations guidance center regarding the status of the hospitals for proper guidance of the ambulances and distribution of the injured
- Supervising the proper distribution of the injured among the hospitals based on their existing capacities
- Preparing statistics and a list of the injured
- Monitoring the status of the hospitals
- Addressing complaints related to the injured of the incident
- Announcing the shortage of equipment and human resources of the hospitals in incidents and disasters to the crisis operations guidance center
- Documenting all actions taken
- Reporting the moment-by-moment conditions of the hospitals and the injured to the crisis operations guidance center
- Following up on the status of the injured in the hospitals
- Announcing the return to normal conditions to the hospitals
- Receiving and evaluating the final performance report of the hospitals

#### Duties of Collaborating Units
- Continuous exchange of information
- Establishing safety and security of the treatment affairs guidance and information headquarters
- Providing the required supplies and equipment for the hospitals
- Establishing effective communication between the guidance headquarters and other required units

### Appendix S-1.7: Primary Medical Search and Rescue

```
Responsible Unit: Pre-hospital Medical Operations
Collaborating Units: Crisis Operations Guidance Center
```

#### **Description of Function**
One of the first actions taken after an incident occurs is the search and rescue operation. The decision to perform this operation is based on considering all existing hazards and taking the best action for the largest number of affected people. Since this operation is professionally performed by trained operational forces of the fire department or the Red Crescent, etc., in the absence of these organizations and volunteer groups, it may be necessary for those emergency personnel who have received sufficient training to also perform search and rescue actions for the emergency evacuation of the injured from the hazardous environment. These actions should not lead to endangering the health of the personnel and the injured.

#### Duties of the Responsible Unit
- Scene assessment
- Observing safety principles for personnel and the injured
- Using the required personal protective equipment
- A thorough search of the area to find the injured/individuals and to reach the missing persons
- Marking the areas where the search has been conducted or is being conducted
- Rescuing the injured/individuals based on the guidelines
- Performing primary triage and vital actions
- Proper transfer of the injured/individuals to the collection point
- Active communication with the operations commander

#### Duties of Collaborating Units
- Exchanging information regarding the type of incident and the safety and security status of the area


**Implementation Guideline 1 - List of Primary Medical Search and Rescue Equipment for an Ambulance in Incidents and Disasters**
- This list is prepared and communicated nationally by the Disaster and Emergency Medical Center of the Ministry of Health.


### **Appendices**
It should be noted that the first priority for performing all the actions mentioned in this operational plan is with the colleagues and affiliated units of the Disaster and Emergency Medical Center and the Crisis Operations Guidance Center (EOC) of the university, and if cooperation from other deputies and university units is needed, the best unit or person (appropriate to the need) will be determined and employed by the Crisis Operations Guidance Center (EOC). For this purpose, it is necessary that the necessary predictions and coordinations be made by the secretariat of the Health and Treatment in Emergencies Working Group of that university when developing the preparedness plan of the university of medical sciences. Also, when planning to provide the vital services included in this plan, based on the existing capabilities, resources, and capacities of the deputies and university units, the selection of the collaborating unit or person will be made.
