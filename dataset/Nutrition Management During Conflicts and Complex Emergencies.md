## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Why Nutrition Matters in Conflicts

Nutrition intervention in crisis settings serves three fundamental purposes that are critical for humanitarian response:

#### 1.1.3 **Saving Lives Through Immediate Nutritional Support**

During conflicts and complex emergencies, malnutrition becomes a primary cause of excess mortality, particularly among children under five years of age. Studies have demonstrated that malnutrition is associated with 45% of all child deaths globally, with this proportion increasing significantly during humanitarian crises (Black et al., 2013). Emergency nutrition interventions, particularly the treatment of severe acute malnutrition (SAM), can reduce case fatality rates from 20-30% to less than 5% when implemented according to international protocols (WHO, 2013).

The immediate lifesaving impact occurs through:
- **Treatment of severe acute malnutrition**: Preventing death from metabolic complications and infections
- **Prevention of micronutrient deficiencies**: Reducing mortality from measles, diarrhea, and other infectious diseases
- **Early detection and referral**: Identifying at-risk individuals before complications develop
- **Therapeutic feeding programs**: Providing specialized nutritional rehabilitation for severely malnourished individuals

#### 1.1.4 **Protecting Health by Preventing Malnutrition-Related Diseases**

Malnutrition severely compromises immune function, creating a vicious cycle where undernourished individuals are more susceptible to infections, and infections further worsen nutritional status. This synergistic relationship, termed the "malnutrition-infection complex," accounts for substantial morbidity and mortality in emergency settings (Katona & Katona-Apte, 2008).

Protection of health occurs through:
- **Immunological support**: Adequate nutrition maintains immune system function, reducing susceptibility to communicable diseases
- **Micronutrient supplementation**: Vitamin A reduces measles mortality by 50%, while zinc supplementation reduces diarrhea duration and severity
- **Prevention of growth faltering**: Protecting children from irreversible developmental consequences
- **Maintenance of physiological functions**: Supporting metabolic processes, wound healing, and recovery from illness

#### 1.1.5 **Supporting Recovery of Affected Populations**

Beyond immediate survival, adequate nutrition is essential for long-term recovery and resilience. Malnutrition in early life causes irreversible damage to physical growth and cognitive development, perpetuating cycles of poverty and vulnerability (Victora et al., 2008).

Recovery support includes:
- **Cognitive development**: Preventing irreversible deficits in learning capacity and educational achievement
- **Economic productivity**: Maintaining human capital and workforce capacity
- **Social cohesion**: Supporting community resilience and social structures
- **Generational health**: Preventing intergenerational transmission of malnutrition

### 1.2 The Impact of Emergencies on Nutrition

Armed conflicts and displacement emergencies create severe disruptions that fundamentally compromise population health through multiple interconnected pathways. The conceptual framework for understanding nutrition in emergencies recognizes that malnutrition results from immediate, underlying, and basic causes, all of which are profoundly disrupted during conflicts (UNICEF, 1990; Young & Jaspars, 2006).

#### **Disrupted Food Access**

Food systems collapse during conflicts through multiple mechanisms:

**Agricultural Production Disruption**:
- Displacement of farming populations from productive land
- Destruction or abandonment of crops and agricultural infrastructure
- Loss of agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizers, tools)
- Disruption of seasonal agricultural activities
- Land contamination from unexploded ordnance or chemical weapons
- Loss of livestock through theft, slaughter, or disease

**Market Failure**:
- Collapse of supply chains and transportation networks
- Hyperinflation and currency devaluation
- Price speculation and market manipulation
- Reduced purchasing power due to lost livelihoods
- Breakdown of credit systems and financial services
- Cross-border trade restrictions

**Food Distribution Challenges**:
- Insecurity preventing humanitarian access
- Destruction of transportation infrastructure (roads, bridges, ports)
- Fuel shortages limiting distribution capacity
- Targeting of food convoys and warehouses
- Administrative barriers and bureaucratic impediments
- Deliberate food blockades as weapons of warfare

Evidence from the Syrian conflict demonstrates that food prices increased by 300-800% in besieged areas, while availability decreased by more than 90%, creating catastrophic food insecurity affecting millions (FAO, 2017).

#### **Loss of Clean Water and Sanitation**

Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) conditions deteriorate rapidly during conflicts, creating conditions for waterborne disease outbreaks and worsening nutritional status:

**Water Infrastructure Damage**:
- Destruction of water treatment plants and distribution networks
- Contamination of water sources from damaged sewage systems
- Targeting of water infrastructure as military strategy
- Loss of electricity for water pumping and treatment
- Depletion of groundwater resources due to overuse
- Chemical or biological contamination of water supplies

**Sanitation System Collapse**:
- Destruction of sewage treatment facilities
- Open defecation in displacement settings
- Accumulation of solid waste
- Vector proliferation (flies, mosquitoes, rodents)
- Overcrowding in displacement camps exceeding sanitation capacity

**Health Consequences**:
- Diarrheal disease outbreaks (cholera, shigellosis, typhoid)
- Parasitic infections reducing nutrient absorption
- Acute malnutrition exacerbated by repeated infections
- Increased nutritional requirements due to infection-related losses
- Environmental enteropathy in children affecting growth

Studies in conflict-affected regions demonstrate that diarrheal disease incidence can increase 10-20 fold compared to pre-conflict levels, with direct consequences for nutritional status, particularly among children under five (Connolly et al., 2004).

#### **Healthcare System Breakdown**

Health services that prevent, detect, and treat malnutrition become severely compromised:

**Physical Infrastructure Damage**:
- Direct attacks on hospitals and clinics (violations of international humanitarian law)
- Destruction of medical equipment and supplies
- Loss of cold chain for vaccines and therapeutic supplies
- Damage to referral pathways and transportation systems

**Human Resource Depletion**:
- Death, injury, or displacement of healthcare workers
- Brain drain of qualified medical professionals
- Inability to pay salaries leading to abandonment of posts
- Trauma and burnout among remaining staff
- Targeting of healthcare workers

**Service Interruption**:
- Cessation of preventive services (immunization, antenatal care)
- Interruption of nutrition surveillance and screening
- Closure of therapeutic feeding programs
- Loss of supply chains for therapeutic foods and medicines
- Inability to manage complications of malnutrition

**Disease Surveillance Collapse**:
- Loss of early warning systems for disease outbreaks
- Inability to monitor nutrition indicators
- Delayed detection of deteriorating nutrition situations
- Inadequate data for evidence-based response

Research from Yemen demonstrates that the conflict reduced functioning health facilities by 50%, while simultaneously increasing the burden of disease, creating a catastrophic public health emergency with malnutrition rates reaching famine levels in some areas (UNICEF, 2018).

#### **Increased Vulnerability of Specific Populations**

Conflicts disproportionately affect already vulnerable groups, creating layers of compounded risk:

**Children (0-5 years)**:
- Highest risk of acute malnutrition and death
- Rapid deterioration due to high nutritional requirements for growth
- Increased susceptibility to infections
- Risk of permanent developmental damage from early malnutrition
- Disruption of infant and young child feeding practices
- Loss of caregivers and family structures

**Pregnant and Lactating Women**:
- Increased nutritional requirements during pregnancy and lactation
- Risk of maternal mortality and morbidity
- Intrauterine growth restriction leading to low birth weight
- Impaired lactation due to maternal malnutrition
- Obstetric complications without access to healthcare
- Gender-based violence and exploitation

**Elderly Populations**:
- Chronic diseases complicated by food insecurity
- Reduced mobility limiting access to food and services
- Social isolation and loss of support networks
- Specific nutritional requirements for age-related conditions
- Difficulty adapting to displacement conditions

**Chronically Ill Individuals**:
- HIV/AIDS patients with increased nutritional needs
- Tuberculosis patients requiring adequate nutrition for treatment success
- Non-communicable diseases requiring specific dietary management
- Mental health conditions affecting food intake
- Interruption of medical treatments and medications

**Displaced Persons**:
- Loss of all assets and livelihoods
- Dependence on humanitarian assistance
- Overcrowded and unsanitary living conditions
- Limited access to services and resources
- Prolonged displacement creating chronic vulnerability
- Secondary displacement multiplying trauma

The 2011-2012 famine in Somalia demonstrated how these factors converge: conflict restricted humanitarian access, displaced populations lost livelihoods, drought destroyed food production, disease outbreaks overwhelmed health systems, and mortality rates reached catastrophic levels, with an estimated 260,000 deaths, half of whom were children under five (Checchi & Robinson, 2013).

## 2. Scope and Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Objectives

This framework aims to provide evidence-based guidance for nutrition management in conflicts and complex emergencies, addressing both immediate humanitarian needs and longer-term recovery:

#### 1. **Provide an Overview of Nutritional Needs During Disasters and Complex/Chronic Emergencies**

**Assessment of Population Nutritional Requirements**:

The framework emphasizes context-specific assessment of nutritional needs based on:

- **Demographic composition**: Age and sex distribution, with particular attention to high-risk groups
- **Baseline nutritional status**: Pre-existing malnutrition rates and micronutrient deficiencies  
- **Disease burden**: Prevalence of infectious diseases affecting nutritional status
- **Food security situation**: Availability, access, and utilization of food
- **Duration and phase of emergency**: Acute crisis vs. protracted emergency
- **Environmental conditions**: Climate, season, water availability

**Energy and Nutrient Requirements**:

Population energy requirements in emergencies are calculated based on:
- **Basal metabolic rate (BMR)**: Varying by age, sex, and physiological status
- **Physical activity level (PAL)**: Considering displacement activities and labor demands
- **Thermal environment**: Increased needs in cold climates
- **Physiological status**: Pregnancy, lactation, growth, illness
- **Catch-up growth**: Additional requirements for malnourished individuals recovering

The Sphere Handbook (2018) provides detailed guidance:
- **Average population**: 2,100 kcal/person/day minimum
- **Protein**: 10-12% of total energy, minimum 0.75 g/kg body weight
- **Fat**: 17% of total energy minimum (35% for complementary foods)
- **Micronutrients**: Meeting Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs) for vulnerable groups

**Specific Nutritional Needs by Population Group**:

*Infants (0-6 months)*:

- **Urban emergencies**: Different access patterns and market-based interventions
- **Cold climates**: Increased energy requirements for thermogenesis
- **Disease outbreaks**: Adjusted protocols for infection control and treatment

#### 2. **Build Awareness and Understanding Essential for Effective Nutrition Response**

**Evidence-Based Decision Making**:

Effective nutrition response requires understanding of:

- **Conceptual frameworks**: UNICEF malnutrition framework, linking immediate, underlying, and basic causes
- **Assessment methodologies**: Standardized surveys (SMART), rapid assessments, sentinel site surveillance
- **Intervention options**: Evidence-based menu of interventions appropriate for different contexts
- **Quality standards**: Sphere standards, WHO/UNICEF guidelines, national protocols
- **Monitoring systems**: Indicators for program performance and impact

**Multi-sectoral Integration**:

Nutrition outcomes depend on integration with:

- **Food security**: Ensuring adequate quantity and quality of food
- **Health services**: Treating infections, immunization, disease management
- **WASH**: Clean water, sanitation, hygiene promotion
- **Protection**: Preventing gender-based violence, ensuring safe access to services
- **Education**: School feeding, nutrition education, behavior change
- **Livelihoods**: Supporting income generation and food production
- **Shelter**: Adequate housing with facilities for food preparation

**Coordination Mechanisms**:

Understanding effective coordination requires knowledge of:

- **Cluster system**: Nutrition cluster (led by UNICEF) and inter-cluster coordination
- **Government leadership**: National coordination mechanisms and line ministries
- **Information management**: Shared databases, assessment registries, activity mapping
- **Resource mobilization**: Strategic response plans, funding mechanisms
- **Accountability frameworks**: Humanitarian accountability to affected populations

**Capacity Development**:

Building sustainable response capacity includes:

- **Training programs**: Standardized curricula for different cadres (CMAM, IYCF-E, nutrition survey methods)
- **Mentoring systems**: On-the-job support and supervision
- **Institutional strengthening**: Supporting national health and nutrition systems
- **Community engagement**: Building local capacity for prevention and early response
- **Knowledge management**: Documentation, learning, and adaptive management

**Advocacy and Resource Mobilization**:

Awareness building for:

## 3. Key Definitions

### 3.1 UNICEF Definition

UNICEF, as the lead UN agency for nutrition in emergencies, provides a comprehensive framework:

> "Nutrition in emergencies ensures that **children and women** have access to **lifesaving nutrition services**, including **prevention, detection, and treatment of malnutrition**, with an emphasis on **infant and young child feeding (IYCF)** and micronutrient support."

**Detailed Analysis of Key Priority Areas:**

#### **Children and Women as Primary Beneficiaries**

The focus on children and women is based on strong epidemiological and biological evidence:

**Children (especially under 5 years)**:
- Account for the majority of malnutrition-related deaths in emergencies
- Highest nutritional vulnerability due to:
  - Rapid growth requiring high nutrient density per kilogram body weight
  - Immature immune systems increasing infection susceptibility  
  - Limited physiological reserves to withstand nutritional stress
  - Critical windows for development that cannot be recovered if missed
  - Dependence on caregivers for feeding and care

Anthropometric assessment focuses on:
- **Wasting (acute malnutrition)**: Weight-for-height Z-score < -2 SD or MUAC < 125 mm
- **Stunting (chronic malnutrition)**: Height-for-age Z-score < -2 SD
- **Underweight**: Weight-for-age Z-score < -2 SD

**Women (especially pregnant and lactating)**:
- Nutritional status directly affects maternal and child survival:
  - Maternal undernutrition increases risk of maternal mortality, low birth weight, and neonatal death
  - Low birth weight infants have 5-10 times higher mortality risk
  - Maternal micronutrient deficiencies affect fetal development and breastfeeding capacity
  - Maternal mental health affects infant feeding and care practices

- Gender-specific vulnerabilities:
  - Intra-household food distribution favoring males in some contexts
  - Increased burden of care work limiting self-care
  - Sexual and gender-based violence affecting nutritional status
  - Early pregnancy and closely spaced pregnancies depleting nutritional reserves

Assessment includes:
- **Maternal BMI**: < 18.5 kg/m² indicating undernutrition
- **MUAC in pregnancy**: < 210-230 mm (context-specific cutoffs)
- **Anemia**: Hemoglobin < 11.0 g/dL in pregnancy, < 12.0 g/dL in non-pregnant women

#### **Lifesaving Nutrition Services**

These encompass the continuum of essential services that directly prevent mortality:

**Community-Based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM)**:
- **Outpatient Therapeutic Program (OTP)**: Treating SAM without medical complications using Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF)
- **Stabilization Centers (SC)**: Inpatient treatment for SAM with medical complications using F-75 and F-100 therapeutic milks
- **Targeted Supplementary Feeding Program (TSFP)**: Treating moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) using Ready-to-Use Supplementary Food (RUSF)

Program outcomes:
- Recovery rate > 75%
- Death rate < 10% (< 5% in outpatient)
- Defaulter rate < 15%
- Coverage > 50% (> 70% in well-functioning programs)

**Emergency Micronutrient Interventions**:
- Vitamin A supplementation (reducing measles mortality by 50%)
- Multiple micronutrient powders for children 6-59 months
- Iron and folic acid for pregnant women
- Zinc for diarrhea treatment

**Blanket Supplementary Feeding Programs (BSFP)**:
- Provided when GAM > 15% or 10-15% with aggravating factors
- Prevents deterioration to severe malnutrition
- Supports vulnerable groups during critical periods

#### **Prevention, Detection, and Treatment of Malnutrition**

This three-pronged approach addresses malnutrition comprehensively:

**Prevention**:
- **Primary prevention**: 
  - Optimal IYCF practices (exclusive breastfeeding, appropriate complementary feeding)
  - Micronutrient supplementation and fortification
  - General food distribution ensuring minimum dietary requirements
  - WASH interventions reducing infection burden
  - Immunization protecting against vaccine-preventable diseases

- **Secondary prevention**:
  - Growth monitoring and promotion
  - Early detection of deteriorating food security
  - Seasonal anticipatory interventions
  - Blanket supplementary feeding in high-risk periods

**Detection**:
- **Active case finding**:
  - Community-based screening using MUAC by mother/community health workers
  - Systematic screening at health facilities, feeding programs, and distribution points
  - Door-to-door screening in high-risk areas
  - Mass screening campaigns

- **Surveillance systems**:
  - Sentinel site surveillance for trend monitoring
  - Nutrition surveys (SMART methodology) every 3-6 months
  - Real-time mortality surveillance
  - Integration with health information systems

**Treatment**:

  - Staff competency assessment and training

#### **Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF)**

IYCF in emergencies requires special emphasis because:

**Critical Importance**:
- Suboptimal IYCF is the greatest risk factor for malnutrition and death in children under 2
- Breastfeeding reduces diarrhea mortality by 50% and acute respiratory infection by 30%
- Inappropriate infant feeding in emergencies can increase mortality 10-25 fold
- Complementary feeding period (6-24 months) is highest risk for growth faltering

**Core IYCF-E Interventions**:

*Breastfeeding Protection and Support*:
- Protect, promote, and support exclusive breastfeeding for first 6 months
- Continue breastfeeding with complementary foods up to 2 years and beyond
- Create enabling environment (baby-friendly spaces, privacy, time for mothers)
- Psychosocial support for stressed and traumatized mothers
- Wet-nursing or relactation support where culturally appropriate
- Skilled breastfeeding counseling and problem-solving

*Breast-milk Substitute (BMS) Control*:

#### **Micronutrient Support**

Micronutrient interventions are critical because:

**Deficiency Prevalence in Emergencies**:
- Vitamin A deficiency: Increases measles, diarrhea, and respiratory infection mortality
- Iron deficiency anemia: Affects 50-70% of pregnant women, impairing maternal and fetal health
- Iodine deficiency: Causes irreversible brain damage if occurring during pregnancy/infancy
- Zinc deficiency: Impairs immune function and wound healing
- Folate deficiency: Causes neural tube defects and megaloblastic anemia

**Evidence-Based Interventions**:

*Vitamin A Supplementation*:
- Children 6-59 months: 100,000-200,000 IU every 4-6 months
- Post-partum women: 200,000 IU within 6 weeks
- During measles outbreak: Therapeutic doses for all cases
- Impact: 23-34% reduction in all-cause child mortality

*Iron and Folic Acid (IFA)*:
- Pregnant women: 30-60 mg iron + 400 μg folic acid daily
- Children and non-pregnant women in high anemia prevalence
- Impact: Reduces maternal anemia by 50-70%, improves birth outcomes

*Multiple Micronutrient Powders (MNP)*:
- Children 6-59 months: Home fortification with 15 micronutrients
- Distribution: Sachets for daily or flexible use (2-3 times/week)
- Impact: Reduces anemia by 31%, improves iron status

*Zinc for Diarrhea Treatment*:
- 10-20 mg daily for 10-14 days during diarrhea episode  
- Reduces duration by 25%, severity by 30%, and recurrence
- Included in integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI)

*Iodized Salt*:
- General population intervention
- Minimum 15 ppm iodine at household level
- Prevents goiter, cretinism, and developmental delays

**Implementation Strategies**:
- Integration with existing platforms (immunization, maternal-child health)
- Community distribution systems
- Mass campaigns for rapid coverage
- Fortification of general food ration when feasible
- Monitoring for coverage, compliance, and adverse effects

### 3.2 WHO Definition

The World Health Organization provides a complementary definition emphasizing clinical and public health dimensions:

> "The coordinated provision of **nutrient-rich foods**, **micronutrient support**, and **therapeutic care** to reduce **malnutrition-related mortality and morbidity** during humanitarian crises."

**Detailed Analysis of Key Components:**

#### **Nutrient-Rich Food Provision**

WHO emphasizes food-based approaches as the foundation of nutrition security:

**General Food Distribution (GFD)**:

Meeting minimum nutritional requirements through:
- **Energy**: 2,100 kcal/person/day average (accounts for population age/sex distribution)
- **Protein**: 10-12% of energy (52-63 g/day), including adequate essential amino acids
- **Fat**: Minimum 17% of energy (40 g/day) for energy density and fat-soluble vitamins
- **Micronutrients**: Meeting Recommended Nutrient Intakes through diverse diet or fortification

Food basket composition considerations:
- **Staple cereal** (wheat, maize, rice): 400-450 g/person/day
- **Pulses** (beans, lentils): 40-60 g/person/day providing protein and micronutrients
- **Fortified vegetable oil**: 25-30 g/person/day for energy and vitamins A, D, E

- Carefully balanced electrolytes addressing metabolic disturbances

*Ready-to-Use Supplementary Food (RUSF)*:
- For MAM treatment: 500 kcal/day for children, 1,000 kcal/day for pregnant/lactating women
- Lower energy density than RUTF (350-450 kcal/100g)
- Fortified with essential micronutrients

#### **Micronutrient Support Programs**

WHO guidelines emphasize strategic micronutrient interventions:

**Population-Wide Interventions**:
- **Fortification**: Salt iodization, flour fortification with iron/folic acid/B-vitamins
- **Dietary diversity**: Promotion of varied diet when markets function
- **Food-based approaches**: Home gardens, small-scale livestock where feasible

**Targeted Supplementation**:

*High-Risk Groups*:
- Pregnant women: IFA, calcium in hypertension-prone populations
- Lactating women: Vitamin A post-partum
- Children 6-59 months: Vitamin A, MNP, deworming
- Adolescent girls: Weekly IFA in anemia-endemic areas

*Emergency-Specific Protocols*:
- **Measles outbreak**: Vitamin A for all cases (reduces mortality by 50%)
- **Acute watery diarrhea**: Zinc supplementation for 10-14 days
- **Population displacement**: Blanket micronutrient distribution initially
- **Prolonged siege**: Emergency stocks of micronutrient supplements

**Quality Assurance**:
- Procurement of WHO-prequalified products

- **Cautious feeding**: F-75 in small frequent feeds (every 2-3 hours)
- **Antibiotics**: Routine broad-spectrum treatment
- **Monitoring**: Hourly vital signs initially, daily weight

*Transition Phase*:
- Gradual increase to F-100 when appetite returns and complications resolve
- Preparation for outpatient care
- Caregiver training on RUTF administration

*Inpatient Therapeutic Feeding Programs*:
- For contexts without CMAM capacity
- Longer hospital stays with full rehabilitation
- Higher cost and lower coverage than outpatient approaches

**Community-Based Therapeutic Care (CTC/CMAM)**:

WHO endorses community-based approaches for:
- Higher coverage (60-90% vs. 10-20% facility-based)
- Lower cost per child recovered
- Reduced mortality through early detection
- Less disruption to family life
- Reduced disease transmission risk

**Components**:
- Active case finding and referral
- Outpatient care for uncomplicated SAM
- Inpatient care for complicated cases
- Linkages to supplementary feeding for MAM
- Follow-up and defaulter tracing

**Medical Protocols**:

*Admission Criteria (SAM)*:
- MUAC < 115 mm and/or
- Weight-for-height Z-score < -3 SD and/or
- Bilateral pitting edema

*Treatment Success Indicators*:
- Weight gain > 5 g/kg/day (outpatient) or > 10 g/kg/day (inpatient)
- Edema resolution
- Return of appetite
- Clinical improvement

*Discharge Criteria*:
- MUAC ≥ 125 mm on two consecutive visits and
- No edema for 14 days and
- Clinically well and alert

#### **Reduction of Malnutrition-Related Mortality and Morbidity**

WHO framework links nutrition interventions to measurable health outcomes:

**Mortality Reduction**:

*Direct pathways*:
- Treatment of SAM prevents death from metabolic complications (case fatality reduction from 20-30% to < 5%)
- Micronutrient supplementation reduces disease-specific mortality (Vitamin A → 23% reduction in child deaths)
- Improved IYCF reduces diarrhea deaths by 50%, pneumonia by 30%

*Indirect pathways*:
- Prevention of malnutrition reduces infection susceptibility
- Adequate nutrition supports immune function
- Integration with health services improves overall survival

**Morbidity Reduction**:

*Reduced infection burden*:
- Zinc supplementation decreases diarrhea incidence by 18%, pneumonia by 13%
- Adequate protein-energy intake maintains immune cell function
- Micronutrients support mucosal barrier integrity

*Improved treatment outcomes*:
- HIV-positive individuals with adequate nutrition have better antiretroviral therapy response
- TB patients with nutritional support have higher cure rates (75% vs. 50%)
- Surgical patients with good nutrition have faster wound healing

*Prevention of long-term consequences*:
- Stunting prevention protects cognitive development
- Micronutrient adequacy prevents irreversible damage (iodine, iron)
- Adolescent nutrition breaks intergenerational cycle

**Measurement Framework**:

WHO recommends monitoring:
- **Nutrition status**: GAM, SAM, stunting prevalence, anemia rates
- **Program indicators**: Admission rates, recovery rates, mortality rates, coverage
- **Impact indicators**: Under-5 mortality rate, cause-specific mortality
- **Service quality**: Adherence to protocols, staff competency, commodity quality

Evidence demonstrates that comprehensive nutrition programs in emergencies reduce child mortality by 30-50%, prevent disease outbreaks, and support recovery of affected populations (WHO, 2000; Collins et al., 2006).

## 4. Core Principles of Nutrition in Conflicts

### 4.1 Target Populations

Nutrition interventions in conflicts must prioritize populations with highest nutritional vulnerability and mortality risk. Evidence-based targeting ensures efficient resource utilization and maximum impact.

#### **Priority Groups:**

##### 1. **Children (0-5 years, school-aged)**

**Infants and Young Children (0-23 months)**:

This age group faces highest malnutrition and mortality risk due to:

*Biological vulnerabilities*:
- **Rapid growth**: Tripling of birth weight by age 1, requiring 100-120 kcal/kg/day (vs. 30-40 for adults)
- **High metabolic rate**: Energy needs per kilogram 3-4 times higher than adults
- **Limited reserves**: Minimal glycogen and fat stores, rapid decompensation during food shortage
- **Brain development**: 85% of brain growth occurs by age 3, requiring adequate nutrition
- **Immune immaturity**: Increased susceptibility to infections, which further compromise nutrition

*Emergency-specific risks*:
- Disruption of breastfeeding due to maternal stress, separation, or death
- Inappropriate use of breast-milk substitutes in unsafe water/sanitation conditions (10-25 fold increased mortality risk)
- Complementary feeding compromise (6-23 months is peak age for growth faltering)
- Loss of routine health services (immunization, growth monitoring, micronutrient supplementation)

*Assessment indicators*:
- **Wasting** (acute malnutrition): Weight-for-height Z-score or MUAC
  - Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM): WHZ < -2 or MUAC < 125 mm (critical threshold > 15%)
  - Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM): WHZ < -3 or MUAC < 115 mm or bilateral edema
- **Stunting** (chronic malnutrition): Height-for-age Z-score < -2
- **Micronutrient deficiencies**: Anemia, vitamin A deficiency, zinc deficiency

*Targeted interventions*:
- IYCF-E counseling and support (exclusive breastfeeding 0-6 months, continued breastfeeding with complementary foods 6-24 months)
- Treatment of SAM and MAM through CMAM programs
- Micronutrient supplementation (Vitamin A, MNP, zinc for diarrhea)
- Blanket supplementary feeding when GAM > 15%
- Growth monitoring and promotion
- Integration with immunization and health services

**Children 2-5 years**:

*Vulnerabilities*:
- Continued high nutritional needs for growth
- Transitioning to family foods (may receive inadequate portions)
- High exposure to environmental contamination (hand-to-mouth behavior)
- Increased mobility and infection exposure

*Specific needs*:
- Adequate diet quantity and quality (minimum 3 meals/day)
- Continued micronutrient support (Vitamin A every 6 months, deworming)
- Access to clean water and sanitation (diarrhea prevention)
- Early childhood development stimulation

**School-Age Children (6-18 years)**:

While mortality risk is lower, this group has specific vulnerabilities:

*Adolescents (10-18 years)*:
- **Rapid growth spurt**: Second highest growth velocity after infancy, requiring increased nutrients
- **Puberty**: Hormonal changes affecting nutritional needs (iron for menstruating girls)
- **Psychosocial stress**: Mental health impacts affecting appetite and nutrition
- **Educational disruption**: School feeding loss, affecting both nutrition and education
- **Exploitation risk**: Labor, early marriage, sexual exploitation compromising nutrition

*Assessment and interventions*:
- BMI-for-age monitoring (thinness or overweight/obesity)
- Anemia screening (especially adolescent girls)
- School feeding programs (when schools function)
- Iron-folic acid supplementation for adolescent girls
- Nutrition education integrated with life skills
- Micronutrient-fortified foods

**Evidence of impact**:
- Appropriate treatment of SAM reduces case fatality from 20-30% to < 5% (Ashworth, 2006)
- Optimal IYCF practices prevent 13-15% of under-5 deaths (Jones et al., 2003)
- Vitamin A supplementation reduces child mortality by 23-34% (Imdad et al., 2017)

##### 2. **Women (Pregnant and Lactating Mothers)**

**Pregnant Women**:

Pregnancy creates profound nutritional demands that are severely challenged in conflict settings:

*Physiological requirements*:
- **Energy**: Additional 350 kcal/day (2nd trimester), 450 kcal/day (3rd trimester)
- **Protein**: Additional 1 g/kg/day for fetal and maternal tissue growth
- **Micronutrients**: 
  - Iron: 27 mg/day (pregnancy increases blood volume by 40-50%)
  - Folate: 600 μg/day (prevents neural tube defects)
  - Calcium: 1,000-1,300 mg/day (fetal skeleton development)
  - Iodine: 250 μg/day (critical for fetal brain development)
  - Vitamin A: 800 μg/day (but < 3,000 μg to avoid teratogenicity)

*Emergency-specific risks*:
- **Maternal undernutrition** → low birth weight → neonatal mortality (5-10 fold increased risk)
- **Anemia** (often > 50% prevalence in emergencies) → maternal mortality, premature birth
- **Micronutrient deficiencies** → congenital abnormalities, developmental impairment
- **Obstetric complications** without access to emergency obstetric care → death
- **Gender-based violence** → physical trauma, psychological stress affecting nutrition

*Assessment indicators*:
- **MUAC**: < 210-230 mm indicates acute malnutrition (context-specific cutoffs)
- **BMI** (if height measured): < 18.5 kg/m² indicates undernutrition
- **Anemia**: Hemoglobin < 11.0 g/dL during pregnancy
- **Weight gain**: Insufficient gain (< 1 kg/month in 2nd-3rd trimester) indicates inadequate nutrition

*Targeted interventions*:
- **Antenatal care** with nutrition counseling
- **Iron-folic acid supplementation**: 30-60 mg iron + 400 μg folic acid daily throughout pregnancy
- **Multiple micronutrient supplements**: UNIMMAP formulation in food-insecure settings
- **Calcium supplementation**: 1.5-2 g/day in populations with low calcium intake and high hypertension risk
- **Balanced energy-protein supplementation**: When baseline energy intake < 2,100 kcal/day
- **Deworming**: Single dose after first trimester in endemic areas
- **Dietary counseling**: Increasing meal frequency, dietary diversity

**Lactating Women**:

*Physiological requirements*:
- **Energy**: Additional 500 kcal/day for milk production (approximately 750 ml/day)
- **Protein**: Additional 17-19 g/day
- **Fluids**: 2-3 liters/day to maintain milk volume
- **Micronutrients**: Increased requirements for all vitamins and minerals secreted in milk

*Emergency-specific challenges*:
- **Maternal stress** → reduced milk production (but usually adequate if mother supported)
- **Inadequate diet** → depletes maternal reserves, reduces milk micronutrient content
- **Work burden** → insufficient time for frequent breastfeeding
- **Lack of support** → early introduction of breast-milk substitutes
- **Social disruption** → loss of grandmother support and cultural practices

*Interventions*:
- **Breastfeeding counseling and support**: Problem-solving, building confidence
- **Psychosocial support**: Reducing stress, ensuring rest
- **Dietary supplementation**: Priority for food assistance (500 kcal/day supplementary food)
- **Vitamin A supplementation**: 200,000 IU within 6 weeks postpartum
- **Micronutrient supplementation**: Continuation of prenatal supplements during lactation
- **Baby-friendly spaces**: Safe, private areas for breastfeeding and infant care
- **Community support**: Mother-to-mother support groups, peer counseling

**Evidence of impact**:
- Balanced energy-protein supplementation increases birth weight by 40-60 g (Ota et al., 2015)
- Iron-folic acid supplementation reduces maternal anemia by 70% (Peña-Rosas et al., 2015)
- Multiple micronutrient supplementation reduces low birth weight by 14% and small-for-gestational-age by 8% (Haider & Bhutta, 2017)

##### 3. **Elderly Populations**

Elderly persons (≥ 60 years) are often neglected in emergency nutrition responses despite significant vulnerabilities:

*Age-related changes affecting nutrition*:
- **Reduced energy needs** (10-25% lower than younger adults) but maintained micronutrient requirements
- **Loss of muscle mass** (sarcopenia) → reduced physical function
- **Reduced appetite** → inadequate food intake
- **Dental problems** → difficulty eating
- **Chronic diseases** → specific dietary needs
- **Medication interactions** → affecting nutrient absorption

*Emergency-specific vulnerabilities*:
- **Mobility limitations** → inability to access food distribution, health services
- **Social isolation** → loss of family support, difficulty obtaining food
- **Chronic disease management** → interrupted medications, dietary management
- **Cognitive decline** → difficulty navigating humanitarian systems
- **Discrimination** → de-prioritization in resource allocation

*Assessment considerations*:
- **BMI**: < 18.5 kg/m² indicates undernutrition (< 20 may be more appropriate for elderly)
- **MUAC**: < 210-220 mm suggests increased mortality risk (gender-specific)
- **Unintentional weight loss**: > 5% in 1 month or > 10% in 6 months
- **Functional status**: Ability to perform activities of daily living
- **Chronic disease prevalence**: Diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease

*Targeted interventions*:
- **Modified general ration**: Higher micronutrient density, appropriate food textures

- **Increased energy needs**: 
  - Asymptomatic: 10% above baseline
  - Symptomatic: 20-30% above baseline
  - During opportunistic infections: 50-100% above baseline
- **Nutrient malabsorption**: HIV enteropathy reduces absorption by 20-30%
- **Metabolic alterations**: Increased protein catabolism, altered fat metabolism
- **Micronutrient depletion**: Antioxidants (vitamins A, C, E, selenium) rapidly depleted

*Emergency-specific risks*:
- **Treatment interruption**: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) stock-outs
- **Food insecurity** → poor ART adherence and efficacy
- **Stigma and discrimination** → reduced access to services
- **Opportunistic infections** → rapid nutritional deterioration

*Interventions*:
- **Food-by-prescription**: Therapeutic or supplementary food for malnourished PLHIV
- **Nutritional counseling**: Dietary strategies to maximize absorption, manage side effects
- **Micronutrient supplementation**: Multiple micronutrients at RDA levels (not mega-doses)
- **Integration**: Nutrition services with HIV testing, treatment, and support
- **Food assistance**: Linked to ART adherence support

**Tuberculosis (TB) Patients**:

*Nutrition-TB bidirectional relationship*:
- **TB increases malnutrition**: 20-30% increased energy needs, reduced appetite, malabsorption
- **Malnutrition worsens TB**: Impaired immune function, reduced treatment efficacy
- **Synergy with HIV**: TB-HIV co-infection creates severe nutritional vulnerability

*Interventions*:
- **Nutritional assessment**: All TB patients screened for malnutrition
- **Dietary counseling**: High-energy, high-protein diet
- **Food support**: 500-1,000 kcal/day supplementation for malnourished patients
- **Micronutrient supplementation**: Particularly vitamin D, zinc (supporting immune function)

- Medication management (anti-hypertensives, statins)

*Chronic kidney disease*:
- Protein restriction (if advanced stages)
- Fluid and electrolyte management
- Phosphorus and potassium control
- Dialysis support where feasible

##### 5. **Displaced Persons**

**Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)**:

*Specific vulnerabilities*:
- **Total livelihood loss**: No assets, income, or production capacity
- **Overcrowding**: Camps with > 30,000 people, high disease transmission
- **Inadequate WASH**: Water scarcity, poor sanitation fueling diarrheal diseases
- **Dependency**: Reliance on humanitarian assistance
- **Secondary displacement**: Multiple movements multiplying trauma

*Assessment considerations*:
- **Rapid nutrition surveys**: SMART surveys within 4-6 weeks of displacement
- **Continuous surveillance**: Sentinel sites with weekly reporting
- **Coverage surveys**: Ensuring equitable access to programs

**Refugees (Cross-Border Displaced)**:

*Additional considerations*:
- **Legal status**: Registration determining access to services
- **Camp vs. urban**: Different intervention modalities
- **Protracted situations**: 60% of refugees displaced > 5 years requiring shift from emergency to development approaches
- **Resettlement nutrition**: Transition to new dietary patterns

*Interventions*:
- **General food distribution**: Ensuring minimum 2,100 kcal/person/day
- **Blanket supplementary feeding**: During initial crisis phase
- **CMAM services**: Treating acute malnutrition

### 4.2 Essential Services

Comprehensive nutrition programming in conflict settings requires a continuum of essential services addressing prevention, detection, and treatment of malnutrition.

#### **Prevention:**

Preventive services aim to maintain adequate nutritional status and prevent deterioration to acute malnutrition.

**Nutrition Education and Counseling**:

*Community-level education*:
- **Optimal infant and young child feeding**: Exclusive breastfeeding, appropriate complementary feeding, continued breastfeeding
- **Dietary diversity**: Importance of varied diet from available foods
- **Food safety and hygiene**: Safe food preparation, storage, and handling in emergency conditions
- **Micronutrient-rich foods**: Identification and utilization of locally available nutrient-dense foods
- **Special needs nutrition**: Pregnancy, lactation, illness, elderly care

*Individual counseling*:
- **Skilled IYCF counseling**: Problem-solving for breastfeeding difficulties, complementary feeding challenges
- **Growth monitoring and promotion**: Interpreting growth charts, recognizing faltering, taking action
- **Management of childhood illness**: Feeding during and after diarrhea, fever, respiratory infections
- **Maternal nutrition**: Dietary counseling for pregnant/lactating women

*Delivery platforms*:
- Community health workers and peer counselors (mother-to-mother support groups)
- Health facilities (integration with antenatal care, child health services)
- Nutrition programming sites (CMAM, supplementary feeding)
- Community centers and baby-friendly spaces
- Mass media and community mobilization campaigns

**Micronutrient Supplementation**:

*Evidence-based supplementation protocols*:

**Vitamin A supplementation**:
- **Children 6-11 months**: 100,000 IU every 4-6 months
- **Children 12-59 months**: 200,000 IU every 4-6 months
- **Post-partum women**: 200,000 IU within 6 weeks of delivery
- **Measles outbreak response**: Therapeutic doses for all measles cases

*Rationale*: Vitamin A deficiency increases measles mortality by 4-fold, diarrhea by 2-fold; supplementation reduces all-cause child mortality by 23-34%

**Iron and folic acid supplementation**:
- **Pregnant women**: 30-60 mg elemental iron + 400 μg folic acid daily
- **Lactating women**: Continuation through lactation
- **Adolescent girls** (weekly IFA where feasible): 60 mg iron + 2,800 μg folic acid weekly
- **Children** (in high anemia prevalence): Age-appropriate doses

*Rationale*: Prevents maternal anemia (50-70% efficacy), reduces low birth weight, prevents folate-deficiency anemia and neural tube defects

**Multiple micronutrient powders (MNP)**:
- **Children 6-59 months**: Single-dose sachets with 15 micronutrients (iron, zinc, vitamins A, C, D, B-complex, folic acid)
- **Distribution**: 60 sachets for 2-month period (flexible use 2-3 times/week) OR daily use for 2-4 months
- **Home fortification**: Added to complementary foods just before consumption

*Rationale*: Reduces anemia by 31%, improves iron status, supports growth and development

**Zinc for diarrhea treatment**:
- **Children < 6 months**: 10 mg/day for 10-14 days
- **Children ≥ 6 months**: 20 mg/day for 10-14 days
- **Integration**: With ORS as standard diarrhea treatment

*Rationale*: Reduces diarrhea duration by 25%, severity by 30%, subsequent episodes by 21%, mortality by 23%

**Iodine supplementation**:
- **Population-wide**: Iodized salt in general food ration (≥ 15 ppm at household level)
- **Individual supplementation** (where iodized salt unavailable): Iodine capsules (200 mg) annually

*Rationale*: Prevents goiter, cretinism, irreversible brain damage (IQ reduction of 13.5 points from iodine deficiency)

**Food Fortification Programs**:

*Centralized fortification* (pre-emergency food processing):
- **Wheat/maize flour**: Iron, folic acid, B-vitamins, zinc
- **Vegetable oil**: Vitamins A and D
- **Salt**: Iodine
- **Fortified blended foods**: CSB++/SuperCereal Plus with full micronutrient complement

*Point-of-use fortification*:
- Multiple micronutrient powders (MNP) for home use
- Lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) for children, pregnant/lactating women

*Quality assurance*:
- Procurement of pre-qualified fortified foods
- Testing for fortification adequacy and stability
- Appropriate packaging preventing micronutrient degradation
- Consumer acceptance and utilization monitoring

**Promotion of Optimal IYCF Practices**:

*Exclusive breastfeeding (0-6 months)*:

**Protection measures**:
- **Code compliance**: No distribution of breast-milk substitutes except individual assessment
- **Baby-friendly spaces**: Private, comfortable areas for breastfeeding
- **Psychosocial support**: Counseling for traumatized mothers, stress reduction
- **Time allocation**: Ensuring mothers have time to breastfeed (adequate water collection points, fuel, childcare support)

**Support measures**:
- Skilled breastfeeding counseling (positioning, attachment, problem-solving)
- Management of breastfeeding difficulties (perceived insufficient milk, sore nipples, engorgement)
- Expression and safe storage when mother-infant separation
- Wet-nursing or relactation support where culturally appropriate
- Nutritional support for mothers (adequate diet, fluids, rest)

*Complementary feeding (6-24 months)*:

**Quality standards**:
- **Timely introduction**: Beginning at 6 months (not before, not delayed)
- **Adequate quantity**: Increasing from 2-3 tablespoons/meal to 125-200 ml by 12 months
- **Appropriate frequency**: 2-3 times/day at 6-8 months, increasing to 3-4 times plus nutritious snacks
- **Energy density**: Minimum 0.8-1.0 kcal/g (achieved through added oil, nut pastes, dairy)
- **Dietary diversity**: Minimum 4 food groups daily from: grains/tubers, legumes/nuts, dairy, flesh foods, eggs, vitamin A-rich foods, other fruits/vegetables
- **Responsive feeding**: Active feeding with encouragement, age-appropriate assistance

**Emergency-specific considerations**:
- Specialized nutritious foods when local foods inadequate (SuperCereal Plus, RUSF)
- Appropriate food consistency for age (mashed → chopped → family foods)
- Safe food preparation with limited water and fuel
- Food hygiene in challenging sanitation conditions

*Continued breastfeeding*:
- Promotion of breastfeeding up to 2 years and beyond
- Complementing (not replacing) breast milk
- Supporting sustained breastfeeding during child illness

**Evidence of preventive impact**:
- Optimal IYCF practices prevent 13-15% of under-5 deaths (Jones et al., 2003)
- Micronutrient interventions prevent 5-7% of child deaths (Black et al., 2008)
- Integrated preventive services reduce acute malnutrition incidence by 30-50% (FANTA, 2010)

#### **Detection:**

Early identification of malnutrition enables timely intervention before complications develop, reducing mortality and morbidity.

**Nutritional Screening and Surveillance**:

*Active case finding*:

**Community-based screening**:
- **Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC)**: Simplest, most field-appropriate tool
  - Children 6-59 months: MUAC < 115 mm (SAM) or 115-125 mm (MAM)
  - Pregnant/lactating women: MUAC < 210-230 mm (context-specific)
  - Elderly: Gender-specific cutoffs
- **Bilateral edema**: Pitting edema of both feet/legs (kwashiorkor - SAM)
- **Screening frequency**: Weekly to monthly depending on malnutrition prevalence and resources

**MUAC screening advantages in emergencies**:
- Minimal training required (mothers can measure own children)
- Low cost (color-coded tapes)
- Better predictor of mortality than weight-for-height
- No equipment needed (height boards, scales)
- Rapid (30-60 seconds per child)
- Community-based (no facility visit required)

**Facility-based screening**:
- Systematic screening at all health facility contacts (curative, preventive, immunization)
- Nutrition screening integrated into IMCI assessments
- Growth monitoring at child health visits
- Antenatal care nutrition screening

**Systematic screening campaigns**:
- Mass MUAC screening following population displacement
- Door-to-door screening in high-risk areas
- Screening at food distribution points
- School-based screening for school-age children

*Surveillance systems*:

**Sentinel site surveillance**:
- **Design**: Representative sites across affected area (health facilities, feeding programs, communities)
- **Indicators**: Admissions to nutrition programs, MUAC screening results, mortality data
- **Frequency**: Weekly or bi-weekly reporting
- **Purpose**: Early warning of deteriorating nutrition situation, program monitoring

**Nutrition surveys**:
- **Methodology**: Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) surveys
- **Sampling**: Representative two-stage cluster sampling (minimum 900 children 6-59 months)
- **Indicators**: 
  - Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM): WHZ < -2 and/or edema (critical threshold ≥ 15%)
  - Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM): WHZ < -3 and/or edema (threshold ≥ 2% requiring emergency response)
  - Stunting prevalence (chronic malnutrition indicator)
  - Crude and under-5 mortality rates
- **Frequency**: Every 3-6 months in emergency phase, annually in stable situations
- **Purpose**: Population-level nutrition status, informing program design and advocacy

**Mortality surveillance**:
- Crude death rate (CDR) and under-5 death rate (U5DR)
- Causes of death (malnutrition-related, disease-specific)
- Emergency thresholds: CDR > 1/10,000/day or U5DR > 2/10,000/day
- Real-time reporting for immediate response

**Anthropometric Assessment**:

*Measurements and interpretation*:

**Weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ)**:
- **Calculation**: Child's weight compared to reference median for height
- **Interpretation**: 
  - WHZ < -2 to ≥ -3: Moderate acute malnutrition (MAM)
  - WHZ < -3: Severe acute malnutrition (SAM)
- **Limitations**: Requires equipment (scale, height board), trained staff, calculations; less feasible in community settings

**Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)**:
- **Measurement**: Left arm circumference at midpoint between shoulder and elbow
- **Interpretation**:
  - 115-125 mm: MAM (yellow zone on tape)
  - < 115 mm: SAM (red zone on tape)
- **Advantages**: Community-based, minimal training, strong mortality predictor

**Weight-for-age Z-score**:
- Reflects both acute and chronic malnutrition (composite indicator)
- Useful for growth monitoring
- Cannot distinguish wasting from stunting

**Height-for-age Z-score (stunting)**:
- HAZ < -2: Moderate stunting
- HAZ < -3: Severe stunting
- Reflects chronic malnutrition and long-term development
- Less responsive to short-term interventions

**Edema assessment**:
- Bilateral pitting edema of feet/legs
- Grade +, ++, +++ based on extent
- Any grade of bilateral edema indicates SAM requiring treatment

**Body Mass Index (BMI)**:
- For adults, adolescents, pregnant women
- BMI < 18.5 kg/m²: Undernutrition
- MUAC increasingly used as alternative (simpler, no calculations)

**Clinical Examination**:

*Clinical signs of malnutrition*:

**Severe acute malnutrition**:
- **Marasmus**: Severe wasting, loss of subcutaneous fat, muscle wasting, "old man" appearance
- **Kwashiorkor**: Bilateral edema, skin lesions, hair changes (discoloration, thinness, easy pluckability), hepatomegaly
- **Marasmic-kwashiorkor**: Combined features

**Micronutrient deficiencies**:
- **Vitamin A deficiency**: Night blindness, Bitot's spots, xerophthalmia, keratomalacia
- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Pallor (palms, conjunctiva), fatigue, tachycardia
- **Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy)**: Bleeding gums, petechiae, poor wound healing
- **Vitamin D deficiency (rickets)**: Bowed legs, enlarged wrists/ankles, delayed closure of fontanelle
- **Niacin deficiency (pellagra)**: Dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia (3 Ds)
- **Thiamine deficiency (beriberi)**: Edema, peripheral neuropathy, cardiac failure
- **Iodine deficiency**: Goiter, developmental delays

- Community mobilization for program activities
- Defaulter tracing and follow-up

**Community-led surveillance**:
- Community-based malnutrition surveillance systems
- Participatory monitoring of food security and nutrition
- Early warning of deteriorating situations
- Feedback to health system and humanitarian actors

**Evidence on detection systems**:
- Community-based screening increases program coverage from 10-20% to 60-90% (Guerrero et al., 2010)
- MUAC screening detects 75-85% of children with high mortality risk (Briend et al., 2012)
- Early detection reduces malnutrition complications and treatment duration by 30-50% (Myatt et al., 2006)

#### **Treatment:**

Treatment services aim to restore nutritional status in malnourished individuals, prevent death from complications, and support full recovery.

**Management of Acute Malnutrition (SAM/MAM)**:

*Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) Treatment*:

**Community-Based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM)**:

The CMAM approach integrates multiple service delivery components:

## 5. Key Intervention Areas

### 5.1 Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF)

IYCF interventions are the highest priority in emergency nutrition response due to profound impact on child survival and development.

#### **Exclusive Breastfeeding (0-6 months)**

**Evidence Base:**
- Exclusively breastfed infants have:
  - 14 times lower mortality than non-breastfed infants
  - 50% reduction in diarrhea deaths
  - 30% reduction in pneumonia deaths
  - Optimal growth and cognitive development

**Emergency-Specific Challenges:**

*Maternal stress and trauma*:
- Perceived insufficient milk production (usually unfounded)
- Anxiety and depression affecting milk ejection reflex
- Physical exhaustion and poor nutrition

*Operational response*:
- Psychosocial support (counseling, stress reduction, rest opportunities)
- Nutritional support for mothers (priority food assistance, adequate water)
- Skilled breastfeeding counseling (positioning, frequency, problem-solving)
- Creating enabling environment (baby-friendly spaces, privacy, time)

*Separation and displacement*:
- Mother-infant separation during displacement or hospitalization
- Loss of family support systems

*Response*:
- Keeping mothers and infants together in all settings
- Expression and safe milk storage guidance when separation unavoidable
- Relactation support for separated mother-infant pairs

**Protection Measures:**

*International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes*:

**Prohibited activities**:
- No distribution of infant formula, bottles, or teats in general distributions
- No donations of breast-milk substitutes to emergency response
- No promotional materials or activities
- No free samples to families

**Permitted activities (only after individualized assessment)**:
- Limited, targeted provision for infants who genuinely cannot be breastfed:
  - Maternal death
  - Severe maternal illness preventing breastfeeding
  - Confirmed HIV-positive mother choosing replacement feeding (only if AFASS criteria met: Acceptable, Feasible, Affordable, Sustainable, Safe)
  - Infant with metabolic disorder (e.g., galactosemia)

*AFASS criteria for safe replacement feeding*:
- **Acceptable**: Mother not stigmatized for formula use
- **Feasible**: Time, knowledge, skills to prepare feeds correctly
- **Affordable**: Continuous supply without financial hardship
- **Sustainable**: Consistent access for entire first year
- **Safe**: Clean water, sanitation, fuel for sterilization

**Individual assessment before ANY breast-milk substitute provision:**
- Document reason breastfeeding not possible
- Assess AFASS criteria
- Provide only for identified infant (labeled)
- Demonstrate preparation and sterilization
- Provide supplies for 1 month, reassess before continuation
- Regular home visits to monitor safety

*Source: IFE Core Group (2017). Operational Guidance on Infant Feeding in Emergencies (OG-IFE) v3.0*

**Support Interventions:**

*Mother-to-mother support groups*:
- Peer counseling and experience sharing
- Problem-solving for breastfeeding difficulties
- Mutual psychosocial support
- Community mobilization

*Skilled breastfeeding counseling*:
- **Positioning and attachment**: Ensuring effective milk transfer
- **Feeding frequency**: On-demand, 8-12 times/24 hours (no schedules)
- **Duration**: Allow infant to finish first breast, offer second
- **Night feeding**: Essential for maintaining supply
- **Growth monitoring**: Reassurance that infant gaining adequately

*Common problems and solutions*:

| **Problem** | **Solution** |
|-------------|-------------|
| Perceived insufficient milk | Increase feeding frequency, improve attachment, adequate maternal nutrition/fluids, rest |
| Sore/cracked nipples | Correct positioning/attachment, express milk to soften areola before latch, air dry nipples |
| Engorgement | Frequent feeding, cold compresses before feeding, hand expression if too engorged to latch |
| Mastitis | Continue breastfeeding, antibiotics if fever > 24 hours, rest, fluids |
| Flat/inverted nipples | Breast compression during latch, nipple stimulation before feeding, patience (improves with time) |

**Relactation:**

For mothers separated from infants or who stopped breastfeeding:

*Indications*:
- Mother and infant reunited after separation
- Infant feeding with breast-milk substitutes in unsafe conditions
- Maternal desire to resume breastfeeding

*Protocol*:
- Frequent suckling (8-12 times/24 hours, including night)
- Supplementary feeding using cup or supplementary suckling technique (not bottle)
- Gradual reduction of supplements as milk production increases
- Supportive counseling and encouragement
- Success rate: 50-80% within 2-4 weeks

*Source: WHO (2009). Infant and Young Child Feeding: Model Chapter for Textbooks*

#### **Continued Breastfeeding with Complementary Foods (6-24 months)**

**Timely Introduction of Complementary Foods:**

**Why start at 6 months?**
- Breast milk alone no longer meets all nutritional needs
- Infant developmentally ready (can sit with support, interested in food, tongue thrust reflex diminished)
- Delaying increases malnutrition risk

**Why not before 6 months?**
- Displaces breast milk (optimal food for infants)
- Increases infection risk (food contamination, reduced antibodies from decreased breastfeeding)
- Immature gut increases allergy/intolerance risk

**Emergency guidance**:
- Do NOT recommend early complementary feeding (continues to harm)
- If mother insists infant hungry, increase breastfeeding frequency (improves supply)
- Consider relactation if breastfeeding insufficient

**Complementary Feeding Principles:**

*Age-appropriate feeding (6-24 months)*:

| **Age** | **Frequency** | **Amount per Meal** | **Texture** | **Breastfeeding** |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|------------|------------------|
| 6-8 months | 2-3 meals/day + BF on demand | Start 2-3 tablespoons, increase to 1/2 cup (125 ml) | Mashed, smooth puree | On demand, 8+ times/day |
| 9-11 months | 3-4 meals/day + 1-2 snacks + BF | 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup (125-185 ml) | Finely chopped, mashed with lumps | On demand, 6+ times/day |
| 12-24 months | 3-4 meals/day + 1-2 snacks + BF | 3/4 cup to 1 cup (185-250 ml) | Family foods, chopped/mashed | On demand, 4-6 times/day |

*BF = Breastfeeding*

**Minimum Dietary Diversity:**

Children 6-23 months should receive foods from at least 4 of the following 7 food groups daily:

1. **Grains, roots, tubers**: Rice, wheat, maize, potatoes, cassava
2. **Legumes and nuts**: Beans, lentils, peas, groundnuts
3. **Dairy products**: Milk, yogurt, cheese
4. **Flesh foods**: Meat, fish, poultry, liver
5. **Eggs**
6. **Vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables**: Orange/yellow vegetables, dark green leafy vegetables
7. **Other fruits and vegetables**

*Emergency challenges*:
- Limited food diversity in general ration (typically cereal, pulses, oil, salt, sugar)
- Market failure limiting access to perishable nutrient-dense foods
- Cost barriers to animal-source foods

*Response strategies*:
- Specialized nutritious foods (SuperCereal Plus, RUSF) for children 6-23 months
- Targeted food assistance for families with young children
- Cash/vouchers enabling purchase of fresh foods where markets function
- Home gardening support for prolonged displacement

**Nutrient Density Requirements:**

*Energy density*: Minimum 0.8-1.0 kcal/g
- Achieved by adding:
  - Vegetable oil (2 teaspoons/meal)
  - Groundnut paste/butter
  - Avocado
  - Dairy products

*Protein*: At least 1-2 meals/day should contain animal-source food (meat, fish, eggs, dairy) OR legumes + grains

*Fat*: Minimum 30-45% of energy from fat (essential for brain development, energy density)

**Responsive Feeding:**

*Definition*: Active, responsive feeding where caregiver recognizes infant's hunger and satiety cues and responds appropriately.

*Key practices*:
- Feed directly and assist older infants when self-feeding
- Feed slowly and patiently, encourage but do not force
- Experiment with food combinations, textures, flavors if child refuses
- Minimize distractions during meals
- Make eating time a period of learning and love
- Talk to child and maintain eye contact

*Emergency-specific guidance*:
- Psychosocial stress may affect infant appetite or maternal feeding behavior
- Support caregivers in maintaining positive feeding interactions despite stress
- Address maternal depression/anxiety affecting responsive feeding

**Feeding During and After Illness:**

*During illness*:
- Continue breastfeeding (increases frequency)
- Offer soft, favorite foods in small amounts frequently
- Encourage fluid intake
- Do NOT withhold food (increases malnutrition risk)

*After illness (catch-up feeding)*:
- Offer an extra meal each day for 1 week after illness
- Increase food amount
- Offer nutrient-dense favorite foods
- Continue until child regains lost weight

**Specialized Nutritious Foods for Complementary Feeding:**

*SuperCereal Plus (formerly CSB++)*:
- Fortified blended food (cereal, legumes, milk powder, oil, micronutrients)
- Prepared as porridge (mix with water, cook)
- Provides 787 kcal/100g dry product
- Target: 200g dry product/day (provides ~400-500 kcal prepared)
- For children 6-23 months in food-insecure settings

*Small-Quantity Lipid-Based Nutrient Supplements (SQ-LNS)*:
- Ready-to-use paste (does not require preparation)
- Energy: 118 kcal per 20g sachet
- Typical dose: 1 sachet/day (provides ~120 kcal + micronutrients)
- For children 6-23 months for prevention of malnutrition

*Medium-Quantity LNS (MQ-LNS)*:
- Similar to SQ-LNS but larger dose (50g = 270 kcal)
- For pregnant/lactating women
- Provides additional energy + micronutrients

*Multiple Micronutrient Powders (MNP)*:
- Single-dose sachets with 15 micronutrients
- Sprinkled on prepared complementary food just before eating
- Does not change taste, color, or texture

- Use: 1 sachet/day or flexible (2-3 times/week)

*Source: WHO (2020). Improving Early Childhood Development: WHO Guideline; UNICEF (2019). Infant and Young Child Feeding Programming Guide*

#### **Safe Complementary Feeding Practices**

**Food Safety in Emergency Conditions:**

*Clean preparation*:
- Wash hands with soap before food preparation and before feeding child
- Use clean utensils and cooking equipment
- Wash fruits and vegetables with safe water
- Cook foods thoroughly (especially meat, fish, eggs)

*Safe storage*:
- Feed freshly prepared food when possible
- If storing, cool quickly and refrigerate (or consume within 2 hours)
- Reheat stored food thoroughly before feeding
- Discard leftovers not eaten at meal

*Water safety*:
- Use safe water for food preparation
- Boil water if microbiological safety uncertain
- Store water in clean, covered containers

*Emergency-specific challenges*:
- Inadequate water for cleaning (long queues, distant water points)
- No refrigeration for food storage
- Insufficient fuel for cooking/boiling
- Overcrowding and poor sanitation increasing contamination risk

*Response*:
- Adequate water provision (minimum 15L/person/day)
- Fuel distribution for cooking
- Food hygiene promotion (handwashing, clean utensils)
- Container provision for safe water storage

**Feeding Utensils:**

*Recommended*:
- **Cup and spoon**: For all infants from 6 months
- Safe, easy to clean, supports oral motor development

*NOT recommended*:
- **Bottles and teats**: Difficult to clean in emergency conditions, increased diarrhea risk, interferes with breastfeeding
- Exception: Specific medical indications (cleft palate, neurological conditions)

#### **Protection of Breastfeeding in Emergency Contexts**

**Artificial Feeding Risks in Emergencies:**

Infants not breastfed have dramatically increased mortality risk:
- **Clean water/sanitation**: 2-3 times higher mortality
- **Poor water/sanitation**: 10-25 times higher mortality

*Why risks are amplified in emergencies*:
- Unsafe water for formula preparation
- Inadequate sanitation for bottle cleaning
- Insufficient fuel for sterilization
- Interrupted formula supply → inappropriate substitutions (diluted formula, unsuitable milks)
- Inability to measure/prepare correctly → undernutrition or overnutrition
- Diarrhea from contamination → dehydration and malnutrition

**Operational Protocols:**

*Management of donated or distributed breast-milk substitutes*:

**If unsolicited donations arrive**:
1. Do NOT distribute to general population
2. Store securely under organization control
3. Use only for individual cases meeting Code criteria
4. Document use and beneficiary assessment
5. Coordinate with nutrition cluster to prevent future donations

**Communicating with donors**:
- Explain risks of inappropriate infant feeding in emergencies
- Redirect donations to appropriate supplies (therapeutic foods, micronutrients, maternal nutrition)
- Emphasize breastfeeding protection priorities

*Source: WHO/UNICEF (2018). Ending the Inappropriate Promotion of Foods for Infants and Young Children; Emergency Nutrition Network (2017). Management of Acute Malnutrition in Infants (MAMI) Care Pathway Package*

#### **Appropriate Use of Breast-milk Substitutes (Only When Absolutely Necessary)**

**Criteria for Breast-milk Substitute Use:**

Only provide when:
- **Mother deceased** AND no suitable wet-nurse/milk bank available
- **Severe maternal illness** preventing breastfeeding (very rare):
  - Active untreated tuberculosis (only until 2 weeks after treatment initiation)
  - Severe maternal illness requiring medications incompatible with breastfeeding
  - Active herpes lesions on breast (other breast can be used)
- **HIV-positive mother** choosing replacement feeding AND AFASS criteria fully met (clean water, sanitation, continuous supply)
- **Infant metabolic disorder** (galactosemia, phenylketonuria - extremely rare)

**Individual Assessment Checklist:**

Before any breast-milk substitute provision:

□ Mother-infant pair individually assessed by trained nutrition/health staff  
□ Reason for not breastfeeding documented  
□ Alternative options explored (relactation, wet-nursing, expressed breast milk)  
□ AFASS criteria assessed and fully met  
□ Caregiver demonstrates correct preparation (measurements, mixing, sterilization)  
□ Adequate water, fuel, and supplies available  
□ Provision sufficient for 1 month only  
□ Individual containers labeled with infant name  
□ Follow-up visits scheduled (weekly initially)  
□ Infant growth and health monitored  
□ Caregiver counseled on risks  

**Artificial Feeding Management:**

*Formula preparation guidance*:
- Follow manufacturer's instructions exactly (do not dilute or concentrate)
- Boil water, cool to appropriate temperature (70°C for powder, room temperature for ready-to-feed)
- Measure accurately using provided scoop
- Discard leftover formula (do not save for next feed)
- Prepare only one feed at a time when possible

*Sterilization*:
- Boil bottles, teats, and utensils for 10 minutes daily
- Air dry on clean cloth
- Store in clean, covered container

*Feeding technique*:
- Hold infant during feeding (do not prop bottle)
- Allow infant to control feeding pace
- Watch for satiety cues, do not force to finish bottle
- Feed on demand (approximately 8 times/24 hours initially, decreasing with age)

*Volume requirements*:
- 150-200 ml/kg/day for infants < 6 months
- Divided into 6-8 feeds/day (newborn) to 5-6 feeds/day (6 months)

**Monitoring Artificially-Fed Infants:**

*Weekly visits for first month*:
- Weight monitoring (adequate gain?)
- Illness screening (diarrhea, respiratory infections)
- Observe feed preparation and feeding
- Check water, fuel, and supply adequacy
- Assess caregiver coping and understanding
- Provide encouragement and problem-solving

*Action if problems identified*:
- Weight faltering → check preparation, feeding frequency, illness
- Illness (especially diarrhea) → increase monitoring, treat infections, review hygiene
- Supply problems → immediate problem-solving to ensure continuity
- Consider cup feeding as safer alternative to bottle

**Complementary Feeding for Non-Breastfed Children:**

Children not breastfed require:
- Earlier introduction of complementary foods (from 6 months as per breastfed infants)
- More frequent meals to compensate for missing breast milk
- Higher quantity per meal
- Continued formula until 12 months, then whole milk
- Extra attention to dietary diversity and micronutrient adequacy

### 5.2 Micronutrient Support

Micronutrient interventions are cost-effective, high-impact strategies for preventing malnutrition-related mortality and morbidity in emergencies.

#### **Vitamin A Supplementation**

**Rationale:**
- Vitamin A deficiency increases child mortality from measles (4-fold), diarrhea (2-fold), and all causes
- Supplementation reduces child deaths by 23-34%
- Deficiency prevalence increases rapidly in emergencies due to:
  - Reduced dietary diversity (limited access to animal-source foods, fruits, vegetables)
  - Increased infection burden (infections deplete vitamin A)
  - Interrupted routine health services

**Target Populations:**
- Children 6-59 months in all emergency-affected areas
- Post-partum women (within 6 weeks of delivery)
- All measles cases (therapeutic dose)

**Dosing Schedule:**

| **Population** | **Dose** | **Frequency** | **Timing** |
|---------------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Infants 6-11 months | 100,000 IU | Every 4-6 months | At any contact point |
| Children 12-59 months | 200,000 IU | Every 4-6 months | At any contact point |
| Post-partum women | 200,000 IU | Single dose | Within 6 weeks of delivery |
| Measles cases (any age) | Age-appropriate dose | Days 1, 2, and week 2-4 | At measles diagnosis |

*IU = International Units*

**Delivery Strategies:**

*Mass campaigns*:
- Rapid coverage of emergency-affected population (target 95%)
- 1-2 day campaigns using multiple distribution sites
- Combined with other preventive interventions (immunization, deworming)
- Community mobilization for high turnout

*Routine distribution*:
- Integration with existing health services:
  - Immunization contacts (6, 10, 14 weeks; 9, 18 months)
  - Child health clinics
  - Nutrition programs (CMAM, supplementary feeding)
  - Antenatal/postnatal care
- Opportunity for catch-up doses for children overdue

*Outbreak response*:
- All measles cases receive therapeutic vitamin A
- Consider campaign if measles outbreak in emergency setting

**Quality Assurance:**
- Procure WHO-prequalified vitamin A capsules (color-coded: blue 100,000 IU, red 200,000 IU)
- Cold chain not required (but avoid extreme heat and direct sunlight)
- Monitor coverage (target > 80% of children 6-59 months)
- Train health workers on dosing, administration, recording

**Safety:**
- No adverse effects at recommended doses
- Do NOT exceed 3,000 μg/day in pregnant women (teratogenic risk)
- Post-partum dose safe during lactation

*Source: WHO (2011). Guideline: Vitamin A Supplementation in Infants and Children 6-59 Months of Age*

#### **Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (Pregnant Women, Children)**

**Iron Deficiency Anemia in Emergencies:**

*Prevalence*:
- Affects 50-70% of pregnant women in emergency settings
- Increases maternal mortality (especially hemorrhage)
- Increases low birth weight and preterm birth
- Impairs child cognitive development

*Contributing factors in emergencies*:
- Inadequate dietary iron (limited animal-source foods)
- High phytate content of staple cereals inhibiting absorption
- Chronic infections (malaria, hookworm)
- Short inter-pregnancy intervals
- Poor access to antenatal care

**Supplementation Protocols:**

*Pregnant women*:

**Standard protocol**:
- **Dose**: 30-60 mg elemental iron + 400 μg folic acid daily
- **Duration**: Throughout pregnancy and 3 months postpartum
- **Initiation**: As early as possible in pregnancy (first antenatal visit)

**High anemia prevalence setting (> 40%)**:
- **Dose**: 60 mg elemental iron + 400 μg folic acid daily
- Same duration and initiation

**Side effects and management**:
- Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, constipation, dark stools): Take with food, increase gradually
- If severe intolerance: Reduce to 30 mg and gradually increase
- Black stools are normal (reassure women)

*Lactating women*:
- Continue same dose for 3 months postpartum
- Prevents postpartum anemia
- Replenishes maternal iron stores

*Children in malaria-endemic areas*:
- Hold until malaria controlled
- Risk of increased morbidity if malaria burden high

*Adolescent girls*:

**Weekly supplementation** (where feasible):
- **Dose**: 60 mg elemental iron + 2,800 μg folic acid once weekly
- Prevents anemia in non-pregnant adolescent girls
- Improves iron stores before first pregnancy

**Delivery Strategies:**

*Integration with antenatal care*:
- Supply at each ANC visit (enough until next visit)
- Counseling on importance, side effects, adherence
- Dietary advice (iron-rich foods, absorption enhancers)

*Mass distribution*:
- In settings with limited ANC access
- Community-based distribution by CHWs
- Home visits to pregnant/lactating women

**Adherence Support:**
- Clear counseling on benefits (maternal and infant health)
- Side effect management
- Involving family members (support for adherence)
- Adequate supply (avoiding stock-outs)

**Monitoring:**
- Track distribution coverage (% pregnant women receiving IFA)
- Monitor adherence (pill counts, self-report)
- Hemoglobin testing where feasible (baseline, 3 months, delivery)

- Children receiving inadequate dietary diversity

**Distribution Protocols:**

*Option 1: Flexible use (WHO-recommended for emergencies)*:
- **Dose**: 1 sachet 2-3 times per week
- **Duration**: Long-term (ongoing in protracted emergencies)
- **Rationale**: Prevents micronutrient deficiencies with lower side effect profile

*Option 2: Daily use (for short-term intervention)*:
- **Dose**: 1 sachet daily
- **Duration**: 2-4 months, then reassess
- **Rationale**: Treats existing deficiencies more rapidly

**Usage Instructions for Caregivers:**

1. Prepare child's complementary food as usual
2. Allow food to cool (not hot, to prevent vitamin degradation)
3. Add entire contents of 1 sachet to food
4. Mix well
5. Feed child immediately (do not store mixed food)
6. Ensure child eats entire portion to receive full micronutrient dose

**Key Messages:**
- Does not change taste, color, or smell of food
- Use only once per day (or 2-3 times/week in flexible protocol)
- Do not add to liquids (powder may not dissolve, child may not consume all)
- Can be used with any complementary food
- Continue breastfeeding and dietary diversity efforts

**Delivery Mechanisms:**

*Blanket distribution*:
- All children 6-59 months in affected area
- Monthly distribution (30-90 sachets per child depending on protocol)

- % children consuming MNP at recommended frequency
- Reasons for non-compliance

*Impact indicators*:
- Anemia prevalence (hemoglobin testing in sample)
- Micronutrient status (ferritin, zinc - if laboratory capacity)

**Safety Considerations:**

*Side effects*:
- Darkening of stools (normal due to unabsorbed iron)
- Rare: Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, constipation, diarrhea)
- Very rare: Allergic reactions

*Management*:
- Reassure caregivers about stool color change
- If GI symptoms: Reduce frequency temporarily, then gradually increase
- Ensure powder added to food (not given dry)

*Contraindications*:
- Children with hemoglobin disorders (thalassemia, sickle cell disease) - iron overload risk
- Supplement with non-iron formulation if necessary

*Malaria settings*:
- Safe to use when malaria prevention/treatment services in place
- Benefits outweigh theoretical risks of iron-malaria interaction

*Source: WHO (2016). Guideline: Use of Multiple Micronutrient Powders for Point-of-Use Fortification of Foods Consumed by Infants and Young Children Aged 6-23 Months*

#### **Iodized Salt Distribution**

**Iodine Deficiency Consequences:**

*Health impacts*:
- **Fetal/neonatal**: Miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital abnormalities, cretinism (severe irreversible mental retardation)
- **Childhood**: Impaired growth and development, reduced IQ (13.5 point reduction with deficiency)
- **All ages**: Goiter, hypothyroidism, impaired mental function

*Emergency-specific risks*:
- Interruption of salt iodization programs
- Dependence on non-iodized salt in general food ration
- Increased vulnerability of pregnant women and young children

**Salt Iodization Standards:**

*Adequate iodization levels*:
- **Production level**: 20-40 ppm (parts per million)
- **Household level**: ≥ 15 ppm (accounts for losses during storage/cooking)

**Operational Guidance:**

*Procurement*:
- Specify iodized salt in all food rations
- Quality standards: Potassium iodate (KIO₃) preferred over potassium iodide (more stable)
- Request certificates of analysis from suppliers

*Distribution*:
- Include in general food ration: 5 g/person/day
- Package in moisture-proof containers (iodine losses with moisture exposure)
- Protect from heat and light during storage

*Quality monitoring*:
- Rapid test kits for field testing (colorimetric methods)
- Quarterly testing of ration salt
- Testing at household level (spot-check surveys)
- Target: > 90% households consuming adequately iodized salt

**Consumer Education:**

Key messages for populations:
- Use iodized salt for all cooking and table salt needs
- Store salt in closed containers away from heat and moisture
- Add salt at end of cooking (reduces iodine losses)
- Do not wash salt before use
- Recognize iodized salt packaging/labels

**Individual Supplementation:**

When iodized salt unavailable:

*Iodine supplements*:
- **Non-pregnant adults/adolescents**: 150 μg/day
- **Pregnant/lactating women**: 250 μg/day
- **Children 0-5 years**: 90 μg/day
- **Children 6-12 years**: 120 μg/day

*Iodized oil capsules* (annual dose):
- **Adults and children > 1 year**: 400 mg (= 200 mg iodine)
- **Children 6-12 months**: 200 mg (= 100 mg iodine)
- Use when iodized salt unavailable for extended period

- If child vomits within 30 minutes, repeat dose

*Caregiver counseling*:
- Complete full 10-14 day course even if diarrhea stops
- Reduces future diarrhea episodes for 2-3 months
- Continue feeding during diarrhea (no food restrictions)
- Increase fluids
- Return if danger signs (unable to drink, very lethargic, bloody stools, high fever)

**Delivery Systems:**

*Health facility-based*:
- All cases of diarrhea diagnosed at facility receive zinc + ORS
- Stock at all levels (hospital, health center, health post)
- Training for all health workers on integrated diarrhea management

*Community-based*:
- Community health workers treat diarrhea with zinc + ORS
- Home visits or community case management sites
- Pre-packaged treatment kits
- Referral of complicated cases

*Caregiver distribution*:

- Caregivers trained to recognize diarrhea and initiate treatment
- Supply adequate for 2-3 episodes per child

**Monitoring:**

*Coverage*:
- % children with diarrhea receiving zinc (target > 80%)
- % children with diarrhea receiving ORS (target > 80%)

*Quality*:
- Correct dosing (age-appropriate dose, 10-14 days duration)
- Caregivers can explain zinc purpose and use

*Impact*:
- Diarrhea incidence and duration
- Diarrhea-related mortality

**Integration with CMAM:**
- All children in nutrition programs with diarrhea receive zinc
- Routine zinc supplementation for malnourished children may have additional benefits (under research)

- Enable displaced populations to meet basic needs

**Minimum Food Basket Specifications:**

*Energy and macronutrients*:

| **Nutrient** | **Minimum Standard** | **Note** |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| Energy | 2,100 kcal/person/day | Assumes age/sex distribution, moderate activity |
| Protein | 10-12% energy (52-63 g) | Include animal or pulse protein |
| Fat | 17% energy (40 g) | Essential for energy density, fat-soluble vitamins |
| Essential fatty acids | 4.5% energy | From vegetable oil (linoleic acid) |

*Standard ration composition*:

| **Commodity** | **Quantity (g/person/day)** | **Energy Contribution** |
|--------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Cereal (wheat, rice, maize) | 400-450 | 1,400-1,600 kcal |
| Pulses (beans, lentils) | 50-60 | 180-220 kcal |
| Fortified vegetable oil | 25-30 | 225-270 kcal |
| Salt (iodized) | 5 | 0 kcal |
| Sugar | 15-20 | 60-80 kcal |
| **Total** | **~500 g** | **~2,100 kcal** |

*Fortified foods*:
- **Cereal**: Wheat/maize flour fortified with iron, folic acid, B-vitamins, zinc
- **Oil**: Fortified with vitamins A and D
- **Salt**: Iodized (≥ 15 ppm at household level)

**Ration Adjustments:**

*Climate considerations*:
- **Cold climates**: Increase energy by 100-300 kcal/day (thermogenesis)
- **Hot climates**: Ensure adequate fluid availability

*Activity levels*:
- **High activity** (agriculture, construction): Increase energy by 200-400 kcal/day
- **Low activity** (camp settings with little movement): Standard may be adequate

*Specific populations*:
- **Pregnant/lactating women**: Additional 300-500 kcal through supplementary ration
- **Children 6-23 months**: Specialized nutritious foods in addition to household ration
- **Elderly/chronically ill**: May need modified rations (texture, sodium content)

**Distribution Modalities:**

*In-kind food distribution*:
- **Frequency**: Monthly or bi-weekly distributions
- **Location**: Central distribution points, mobile teams for dispersed populations
- **Beneficiary identification**: Registration, beneficiary cards, household lists
- **Quantities**: Calculated based on household size, adjusted for vulnerability

*Advantages*:
- Direct provision ensures food reaches households
- Appropriate in contexts with market failure
- Can provide specialized/fortified foods not available locally

*Disadvantages*:
- Logistically complex (procurement, transport, storage)
- Beneficiary preference not considered
- Risk of diversion/corruption
- Distribution burden on beneficiaries (transport from distribution point)

**Quality Standards:**

*Food quality*:

- Safe, accessible distribution sites
- Protection from exploitation/abuse
- Timely (predictable schedule)
- Transparent (clear communication on entitlements)

**Monitoring:**

*Coverage*:
- % target households receiving full ration
- % target households receiving ration on time

*Adequacy*:
- Average dietary energy consumption (kcal/person/day)
- Dietary diversity (number of food groups consumed)
- Household food security indicators (Food Consumption Score, Household Dietary Diversity Score)

*Access*:
- Distance to distribution point
- Time spent at distribution
- Safety concerns

*Use*:
- % ration consumed vs. sold/exchanged
- Intra-household distribution (vulnerable members receiving adequate share)

#### **Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA)**

**Rationale for Cash/Vouchers:**

When markets function and food is available, cash or vouchers enable:
- **Beneficiary choice**: Households purchase preferred foods based on needs and culture
- **Market support**: Stimulates local economy, supports local traders
- **Efficiency**: Often more cost-effective than in-kind distribution
- **Dignity**: Reduces stigma, empowers beneficiaries
- **Flexibility**: Can address multiple needs beyond food (shelter, health, education)

**Cash Transfer Modalities:**

*Unconditional cash transfers (UCT)*:
- Households receive cash with no conditions
- Can use for any purpose (food, non-food, services)
- Assumes household best placed to prioritize needs

*Conditional cash transfers (CCT)*:
- Cash linked to specific actions (health visits, school attendance, participation in nutrition education)
- Incentivizes positive behaviors
- More complex to implement and monitor

*Cash-for-work (CFW)*:
- Cash in exchange for labor (infrastructure rehabilitation, agriculture, environmental projects)
- Provides income and maintains/restores assets
- Must ensure fair wages, safe working conditions

**Voucher Modalities:**

*Commodity vouchers*:
- Exchangeable for specific foods at contracted shops
- Ensures nutritional objectives met
- Can specify fortified/nutritious foods

*Value vouchers*:
- Specified monetary value redeemable at contracted shops
- More flexibility than commodity vouchers
- Can restrict food categories if needed

*Electronic vouchers (e-vouchers)*:
- Digital cards or mobile money
- Easier tracking, reduced fraud risk
- Requires technology infrastructure

**Feasibility Assessment:**

CVA appropriate when:

| **Criterion** | **Indicator** | **Assessment Method** |

| Trader capacity | Traders able to supply increased demand | Trader capacity assessment |
| Infrastructure | Banking/mobile money services available (for cash transfers) | Financial service provider mapping |

**Transfer Value Calculation:**

*Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB)*:
- Calculate cost of minimum food basket meeting 2,100 kcal + essential non-food items
- **Food component**: Cost of purchasing standard ration commodities locally
- **Non-food component**: Soap, water, fuel, shelter, health, education costs

*Transfer value options*:
- **Full MEB**: Cover all food and essential non-food (when no other assistance)
- **Food portion**: Cover food needs only (when other sectors provide non-food)
- **Top-up**: Supplement household income to meet minimum needs

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Feasibility assessment**: Markets, security, infrastructure, beneficiary preferences
2. **Modality selection**: Cash vs. vouchers, based on context and objectives
3. **Transfer value calculation**: Based on MEB and household needs
4. **Beneficiary registration**: Targeting, registration, ID provision
5. **Financial service provider selection**: Banks, mobile money, voucher retailers
6. **Distribution**: Cash/voucher provision (monthly, bi-monthly)
7. **Monitoring**: Price monitoring, beneficiary feedback, expenditure tracking, nutrition outcomes
8. **Evaluation**: Impact on food security, nutrition, market dynamics

**Monitoring Indicators:**

*Diversion/misuse*:
- Clear communication on cash purpose
- Post-distribution monitoring of expenditures
- If widespread diversion to non-food, consider vouchers

*Security*:
- Discreet distribution methods (mobile money, bank transfers)
- Safe distribution locations and timing
- Coordination with security actors

*Market disruption*:
- Phased scale-up to allow trader supply adaptation
- Engage traders early in planning
- Consider combining cash with in-kind for items unavailable locally

*Gender-based violence*:
- Distribute to women (control over food purchase decisions)
- Private collection points
- Awareness raising on GBV risks

  - Advantages: Easy logistics, no preparation, long shelf life
  - Challenges: Lower energy/nutrient density, less attractive, cannot replace meals

*Take-home rations (THR)*:
- Food ration for family collected monthly if child attends school
- Incentive for families (especially girls) to send children to school
- Ration size: 10-20 kg cereal/month per child attending

**Ration Specifications:**

*On-site meal*:

| **Component** | **Quantity** | **Energy** |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| Cereal-based dish | 150-200 g | 400-500 kcal |
| Fortified blended food/milk | 50-100 g | 200-250 kcal |
| **Total** | | **~600-750 kcal** |

*Design considerations*:
- Provides 30-35% daily energy needs (meal + snack)
- Culturally appropriate, palatable to children
- Includes animal-source protein 2-3 times/week if possible
- Fortified foods or fresh foods providing micronutrients

*Take-home ration*:
- 10-20 kg cereal + 1-2 kg pulses + 1 L oil per child per month
- Sufficient to incentivize attendance without substituting household food completely

**Implementation:**

- Health screening and referral

*WASH*:
- Handwashing facilities with soap
- Clean
continuing from **School Feeding Programs (section 5.3)**:

---

#### **WASH Integration Support**

To ensure the nutrition impact of school feeding is maximized, programs must include:
- **Safe water supply**: Drinking and cooking water meeting WHO standards.
- **Sanitation facilities**: Gender-segregated latrines, accessible to all students.
- **Hygiene promotion**: Handwashing before meals with soap, supervised sessions.
- **Environmental health**: Waste management around school kitchens and water points.

These WASH measures reduce infection and illness that undermine nutrient utilization.

**Linkages to Local Agriculture (“Home-Grown School Feeding”)**  
Where security permits, sourcing food locally can:
- Stimulate smallholder farm production and local markets.  
- Improve dietary diversity (availability of fresh produce, eggs, dairy).  
- Lower logistic costs and strengthen community ownership.

Procurement policies should, however, ensure:
- Transparent contracting and price monitoring.  
- Food safety and quality standards compliance.  
- Seasonal continuity of supply (buffer stocks where needed).

**Monitoring Indicators**

| **Dimension** | **Indicator** | **Target/Standard** |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Coverage | % of students participating daily | ≥ 90% enrolled children |
| Attendance | Change in attendance/retention rate | ≥ 10% increase vs. baseline |
| Nutrition | Mean meal energy content | 600–750 kcal/meal |
| Health | % schools with functional hand‑washing stations | ≥ 80% |
| Local economy | % food procured from local farmers | ≥ 30% (where feasible) |

| Funding | Short funding cycles, earmarked donations limiting flexibility |
| Sociocultural | Infant feeding taboos, gender roles affecting food access |
| Information | Population movements, missing denominators for coverage |
| Political | Interference in targeting, exclusion of specific groups |

Mitigation includes negotiation through humanitarian access frameworks, decentralized storage networks, flexible financing mechanisms, and strong accountability systems.

## **10. Conclusion (Re‑stated)**

Sustainable nutrition management in conflicts and complex emergencies depends on:
- **Rapid assessment** grounded in standardized, evidence‑based indicators.  
- **Protection of vulnerable groups**, particularly young children and mothers.  
- **Continuum of care** that addresses prevention, detection, and treatment of malnutrition.  
- **Strong coordination** under national leadership adhering to international standards.  
- **Cross‑sector integration** (Health‑WASH‑Food Security‑Livelihoods).  
- **Accountability and learning frameworks** to ensure quality and adaptive management.  
- **Transition planning** to link relief with long‑term recovery and system strengthening.

When implemented collectively, these measures reduce mortality, enhance resilience, and lay the groundwork for rebuilding stable, nutrition‑secure communities after crisis.
