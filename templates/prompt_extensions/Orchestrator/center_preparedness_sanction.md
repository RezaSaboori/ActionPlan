1. **Mandatory Prerequisite Assessment:** The EOP must be based on a preceding **Hazard and Safety Assessment** that identifies threats, estimates the probability of occurrence, and determines the amount of resulting damage. This assessment must be conducted annually.
2. **Governing Strategy:** The main strategy must be the transformation of healthcare facilities from vulnerable entities to **self-sufficient and resilient fortresses** through an integrated approach.

The plan must rigorously adhere to four fundamental principles:

1. **Principle of Continuity of Operations:** Ensuring essential health services are never interrupted, achieved through flexibility and creating surplus capacities.
2. **Principle of Unified Command and Control:** Emphasizing a clear, centralized, and pre-practiced command structure to prevent confusion.
3. **Principle of Optimal Resource Utilization:** Mandating that scarce resources (like medicines, equipment, and time) must be allocated based on **scientific logic and prioritization** to achieve the maximum possible outcome (saving the greatest number of lives).
4. **Principle of Protection of Staff and Patients:** Ensuring the physical and psychological security and health of healthcare personnel as an ethical and strategic imperative.
5. **ICS Implementation:** The hospital is obliged to form and officially announce the **Incident Command System (ICS)** at its own level. This system operates within the university's overall command structure.
6. **Succession Documentation:** The hospital must develop and communicate the **"Command Succession Document,"** identifying successors for all critical positions (e.g., unit head, ward head nurse) to ensure the command chain is never interrupted.
7. **Role-Based Writing:** All responsibilities and duties must be written for **defined organizational roles**in a clear way (e.g., Hospital Director, Facilities Manager, Clinical Supervisor), and **not** for specific individuals (e.g., "Mr. Smith").

The hospital must detail how it implements and localizes the six primary preparedness functions:

| Function Code | Function Title                            | Hospital-Level Rules and Duties                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **P1**        | **Strategic Coordination**                | Participation in stakeholder analysis, determining local roles and expectations from partners, and participation in coordination meetings. |
| **P2**        | **Safety and Hazard Assessment**          | **Conducting an annual hazard assessment** of the facility, collecting and analyzing local data, and participating in preparing the report. |
| **P3**        | **EOP Development**                       | Systematic recording of **lessons learned** from incidents and drills; participation in workshops (maximum 2 months after operation ends); and participation in the annual EOP revision. |
| **P4**        | **Stockpiling of Supplies and Equipment** | Preparing a list of required supplies; developing the relevant protocol; active stockpiling; and performing **periodic control** of reserves. |
| **P5**        | **Personnel Training**                    | Implementing training programs based on the disaster management training matrix, ensuring staff receive basic training on specific functions of other areas, and maintaining a **Crisis Management Training Record** for each staff member. |
| **P6**        | **Personnel Drill**                       | Developing and executing a drill program for managers and staff; developing scenarios and drill evaluation protocols; and maintaining a **Crisis Management Drill Record**. |



1. **Warehouse Obligation:** Each hospital is **obligated to create or equip a secure, disaster-resistant warehouse** with controlled environmental conditions for strategic reserve storage.
2. **Multi-Level Storage Model Implementation:** The hospital must implement the multi-level storage model locally:

  ◦ **Level 1 (Operational Reserve):** Provision of **14 days'** crisis consumption needs in critical departments (emergency, OT, ICU).

  ◦ **Level 2 (Hospital Reserve):** Provision of **30 days'** needs of strategic items (e.g., antibiotics, trauma kits) in a secure hospital warehouse.

3. **Resource Triage Committee:** The plan must mandate the **formation of a "Resource Triage Committee"** (physician, pharmacist, nurse, manager) responsible for developing internal guidelines for optimal consumption management and fair allocation of scarce resources during a crisis.
4. **Consumption Monitoring:** Accurate recording and **real-time reporting of consumption** to the hospital EOC must be a mandated protocol to prevent waste and identify future needs.
5. **Local Supply Chain:** The plan must require the identification of reliable local pharmaceutical and equipment suppliers at the provincial level and the execution of framework contracts with them to accelerate crisis-time purchases.
6. **Source Diversification:** The hospital must identify at least **two alternative supply sources** for each critical item to reduce dependency risk.
7. **Information System Backup:** The EOP must define processes for the **provision and storage of the National Paper Record Crisis Kit** (standardized forms) sufficient for minimum 72 hours of operations, and training personnel for working with agile paper records.
