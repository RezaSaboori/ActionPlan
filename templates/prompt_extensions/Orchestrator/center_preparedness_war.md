## Part One: Rules for the Strategic Action Plan (EOP) Framework (Preparedness Phase)

- **Mandatory Prerequisite: Hazard Assessment:** The EOP must be built upon the results of a **Hazard and Safety Assessment**, which identifies the threats, estimates their probability of occurrence, and determines the level of resulting damage. This assessment must be conducted and reported annually (e.g., in October).

- **Continuous Improvement:** The revision of the EOP must be based on the systematic recording of **lessons learned** from the previous year's incidents and the drills held.

- Governing Principles Rules: The plan must rigorously adhere to four fundamental principles:

  - **Principle of Continuity of Operations:** Requires designing systems with high flexibility and creating surplus capacities to ensure the delivery of essential health services is never interrupted.

  - **Principle of Unified Command and Control:** Emphasizes establishing a clear, centralized, and pre-practiced command structure to prevent confusion and contradictory orders.

  - **Principle of Optimal Resource Utilization:** Mandates that scarce resources must be allocated based on **scientific logic and prioritization (triage)** to achieve the maximum possible outcome (saving the greatest number of lives).

  - **Principle of Protection of Staff and Patients:** Requires prioritizing the physical and psychological security and health of healthcare personnel on par with treating patients.

- Command and Operational Structure Rules: The hospital plan must precisely define the local command structure based on the Incident Command System (ICS) model:

  - **ICS Implementation:** The hospital is obliged to form and officially announce the **Incident Command System (ICS)** chart at its own level, operating under the university's overall ICS.
  - **Commander Designation:** The **head of the unit (Hospital Director)** is the designated Commander of Operations.
  - **Succession Mandate:** The EOP must include rules ensuring the **Command Succession Document** is developed, which identifies successors for all critical positions (e.g., unit head, ward head nurse) to ensure command continuity. The successor is typically the coordinator of the unit's crisis management committee.
  - **Role-Based Writing:** All responsibilities and duties must be written for **defined organizational roles** (e.g., Hospital Director, Nursing Supervisor, Facilities Manager), and **not** for specific individuals, ensuring responsibilities are **clear and unambiguous**.

- Preparedness Levels and Response Trigger Rules: The plan must define clear actions for the staged activation of resources based on codified threat levels, as announced by the national command center.

| Status Code                            | Definition                                              | Mandatory Hospital Preparedness Action Rules                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **White Status (Sustained Readiness)** | Normal situation; absence of imminent threat.           | Development and review of crisis operational plans; continuous conduct of training courses; conducting operational exercises **at least quarterly**; provision and regular rotation of strategic reserves (bringing inventory to **100% of defined level**). |
| **Yellow Status (Warning and Alert)**  | Probability of engagement or crisis in the near future. | Limited, 24-hour activation of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC); immediate review to bring all strategic and consumable reserves to **120% of defined capacity**; hot testing of all generators and backup systems; **gradual reduction of elective surgeries** to free up bed capacity. |

- Mandatory Preparedness Functions (P1-P6) Rules: The Hospital EOP must detail procedures for implementing and localizing the following preparatory functions:

| Function Code | Function Title                            | Hospital-Level Preparation Rules                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **P1**        | **Strategic Coordination**                | Participation in stakeholder analysis; determining the local role and expectations of each partner (e.g., fire department, local suppliers); participation in coordination meetings. |
| **P2**        | **Safety and Hazard Assessment**          | **Conducting the annual hazard assessment** of the facility; collecting and analyzing local data; participating in preparing the assessment report. |
| **P4**        | **Stockpiling of Supplies and Equipment** | Preparing a list of required supplies; developing local protocols; active stockpiling; and performing **periodic control** of reserves. Implementation of the **Multi-Level Storage Model** locally (14 days' needs in critical departments; 30 days' needs in the secure hospital warehouse). |
| **P5**        | **Personnel Training**                    | Implementing training programs based on the national disaster management training matrix; ensuring staff receive basic training on specific functions of other areas; and maintaining a **Crisis Management Training Record** for each staff member. |
| **P6**        | **Personnel Drill**                       | Participation in developing drill scenarios and evaluation protocols; conducting diverse and integrated drills (e.g., simulating power outages, mass casualty incidents, or horizontal/vertical evacuation) **at least quarterly**; and maintaining a **Crisis Management Drill Record**. |



- The plan must address the physical security and self-sufficiency of the facility.

- **Multi-Layer Hardening Implementation:** The plan must require the implementation of a **three-layer defense** for critical infrastructure:

  -   *First Layer (Prevention):* Strengthening the facility (e.g., implementing the "Three-Month Safety Plan" to **secure 100% mobile equipment and objects** in critical departments, securing windows).

  -   *Second Layer (Backup):* 

- **Shelter Preparation:** Identify and prepare the primary shelter (usually in the basement) and alternative safe spaces (e.g., central corridors without windows). The shelter must be designed as an **emergency treatment and survival center** with connections for emergency power, oxygen, and suction.
- **EOC Resilience:** The main Hospital Crisis Operations Command Center (EOC) must be selected at the safest point and equipped with independent communication lines and access to information systems.
- **Evacuation Preparedness:** Prepare and practice the evacuation plan in advance, identifying safe exit routes and an assembly point. Training must be provided for the rapid and safe transfer of patients to the shelter (vertical evacuation).



## Part Two: Rules for Creating Implementing Checklists

Checklists are essential for **Frontline Implementers and Staff** (Level 3) who require a fast, directive, and detail-free tool to perform duties effectively.

1. Structural and Definitional Specifications
2. **Target Audience:** Checklists must be designed for **Frontline Implementers and Staff** (e.g., triage nurse, facilities technical staff).
3. **Mandatory Profile Data:** The document must define:

  ◦ **Checklist Name:** According to the main guideline document.

  ◦ **Relevant Domain:** The relevant directorate or organization.

  ◦ **Crisis Scope:** War / Mass Casualty Incidents.

  ◦ **Checklist Type:** Preparedness Phase.

3. **Reference Protocols:** Must reference higher-level protocols (national/international documents), but the content must be **localized and adapted to the specific capabilities and structure of the hospital** (e.g., defining the roles of security or environmental health units).
4. **Role Assignment:** Must identify the **Process Owner** and the **Actor(s) / Implementer(s)** by position/title. The writing must focus on **defined organizational roles** (e.g., Nursing Supervisor, Facilities Manager), not specific individuals, ensuring responsibilities are **clear and unambiguous**.
5. Pre-Action Parameters
6. **Activation Trigger:** A **clear and specific trigger** must be defined to determine the exact starting point of the operation, preventing premature or late responses.
7. **Objective Definition:** The **Checklist Objective** must be defined, representing the final, measurable goal of the execution.
8. **Executive Steps Detailing:** Time-sensitive preparatory steps must be detailed by time and responsible party.
9. Content Formatting and Style Rules
10. **Directive Language:** Actions must be short, directive, checkable, and must use **simple words, short sentences, and clear, direct, command-style verbs**. Complex language, long sentences, and ambiguous phrases must be strictly avoided as they lead to confusion and delays.
11. **Alignment:** All actions must be **aligned with executive directives and protocols**.
12. **Table Organization:** The content must be organized in a table format containing at least the columns for **Action, Status, and Remarks / Report**.
13. **Status Options:** Status options must be configured based on the action type and must be clear and checkable (e.g., **Executed, Communicated, Reported**).
14. **Remarks/Report:** The **Remarks / Report** column is mandatory for entering relevant explanations, detailed statistical reports (e.g., inventory counts), or necessary coordination notes.
15. Accountability Rule
16. **Execution Confirmation:** A final section for **Execution Confirmation** is mandatory, requiring sign-off by the primary actor or commander, detailing the **Full Name, Date & Time, and Signature**.
