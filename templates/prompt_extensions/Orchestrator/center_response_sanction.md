## Part One: Incident Action Plan (IAP) Framework Rules (Response Phase)

- **IAP Definition and Timing:** The IAP is a dynamic, written document that operationalizes the strategic principles (EOP) for the specific crisis. Its development time begins as soon as the **first Situation Report (SitRep)** is received.
- **Prerequisite Data:** The IAP must be developed based on the results of the **Damage and Needs Assessment** (SitRep), which determines the extent, scope of damage, needs, and available resources locally.
- **Review Mandate:** The IAP must be reviewed **hourly or daily** depending on successive damage and needs assessment reports and changes in the affected environment. The duration of the IAP is equivalent to the duration of the response operation.
- **Planning Responsibility:** The responsibility for developing the IAP rests with the **Planning section** of the hospital's Incident Command System (ICS) and requires approval from the Incident Commander. This process must be participatory, involving all relevant operational units.
- The IAP must clearly establish the hierarchy and utilize delegated emergency authorities to overcome logistical and administrative barriers caused by sanctions.
- **Unified Command Structure:** All operations defined in the IAP must adhere to the **Unified Command Structure (ICS)** model to ensure coordination and prevent the overlap of duties. The EOC must be fully activated.

- **Commander Identification:** The Hospital Director, operating from the Crisis Operations Command Center (EOC) (often referred to as the **health war room**), is the designated **Scene Commander** or **Commander of Operations**.

- **Succession Documentation:** The IAP must confirm the utilization of the **Command Succession Document**, identifying successors for all critical positions (e.g., from hospital director down to unit head) to ensure command continuity during the crisis.

- **Utilization of Delegated Authorities:** The Scene Commander must use the authority delegated to them for immediate action under emergency conditions:

  -   **Personnel Management:** Full authority to modify shift schedules and cancel leave.

  -   **Repurposing Space:** Authority to change the designated use of wards (e.g., converting a non-critical unit into a specialized inventory storage area) without requiring authorization.

  -   **Emergency Procurement:** Authority for **emergency procurement of vital items** from any available source, **outside tender procedures**, using the emergency revolving fund.

- **Catastrophic Authority (Code Purple/Red 2 Rule):** The IAP must incorporate rules for **Code Purple** (or Red 2) status, which is activated if communication with the University EOC is lost for an extended period (e.g., 6 hours). In this scenario, the Hospital Director acts as the **field commander with full authority** to implement all necessary protocols and manage resources without central authorization.

- **Rules for Setting Operational Objectives (IAP Content)** :The IAP defines executable objectives based on the real-time needs assessment caused by the sanctions scenario (e.g., lack of specialized spare parts, dwindling strategic reserves).

  - **Basis and Scope:** Objectives must be determined based on needs, available resources, and covering objectives for **each response phase function** (managerial, specific, and specialized functions).

  - **Format and Measurability:** Objectives must be **clear, operational, measurable, and achievable**. They must state the **main action, its location, and time of implementation**. They do **not** state the method of implementation or the responsible person/group.

  - **Prioritization Mandate:** Objectives must align with the **Principle of Optimal Resource Utilization**. Due to sanction-driven scarcity, objectives must support the Resource Triage Committee's guidelines for allocating scarce resources (e.g., ventilator access, specialized medications) based on scientific logic for maximum possible outcome.

  - **Sanctions-Specific Operational Rules**: The IAP must mandate specific actions to mitigate the core effects of sanctions at the local level:

    1. **Logistics and Supply Management:** The IAP must activate the local execution of the **Multi-Level Storage Model**:
       -   Maintenance of **14 days'** crisis consumption needs (Operational Reserve) in critical departments (emergency, operating room, ICU).
       -  Maintenance of **30 days'** needs (Hospital Reserve) of strategic items (e.g., broad-spectrum antibiotics, anesthesia drugs) in the secure hospital warehouse.

    2. **Resource Triage Committee Activation:** The IAP must mandate the activation and full support of the **Hospital Resource Triage Committee** (consisting of a physician, pharmacist, nurse, and manager) to manage consumption, substitution protocols, and fair allocation of scarce resources.

    2. **Information System Continuity (Offline Mode):** To counter failure of electronic national systems (like Sepas, HIS) due to infrastructure or cyber threats inherent in economic warfare, the IAP must direct the system to implement **"local/offline operation mode"** for critical processes such as admission and service registration.

    2. **Paper Backup Implementation:** The IAP must mandate the immediate use of the pre-stored **National Paper Record Crisis Kit** (standardized forms for all clinical processes) when digital systems fail.

    2. **Security and Safety:** The IAP must include rules for establishing and maintaining security (M12) and ensuring personnel safety (M11) through adherence to personal protective equipment standards and incident site zoning.

## Part Two: Rules for Creating Implementing Checklists 

Checklists are essential tools for **Frontline Implementers and Staff** to execute the immediate actions defined in the IAP accurately and swiftly under stress.

1. Structural and Definitional Rules
2. **Target Audience:** Checklists must be designed for **Frontline Implementers and Staff**, requiring a tool that is fast, directive, and free of extraneous details.
3. **Mandatory Profile Data:** The document must precisely define the following specifications:

  ◦ **Checklist Name** (according to the main guideline).

  ◦ **Relevant Domain** (e.g., Deputy Ministry of Treatment).

  ◦ **Crisis Scope** (Sanctions).

  ◦ **Checklist Type** (Action-Response Phase).

3. **Protocol Referencing:** Checklists should reference **higher-level, officially communicated protocols** (national standards) but must be **localized and adapted** to the specific capabilities and structure of the hospital and its units.
4. **Role Assignment Rule:** Duties must be assigned to **defined organizational roles** (e.g., Facilities Manager, Nursing Supervisor), **not** to specific individuals. Responsibilities must be **clear and unambiguous**.
5. **Role Identification:** The checklist must identify the **Process Owner**, the **Actor(s)/Implementer(s)** by position/title, and the **Operations Commander**.
6. Pre-Action Parameters
7. **Activation Trigger Rule:** Every process must have a **clear and specific trigger** that defines the exact starting point of the operation, preventing premature or disastrously late responses.
8. **Objective Definition Rule:** The **Checklist Objective** must be defined, representing the final, measurable goal of the execution (e.g., creating vacant inpatient beds).
9. **Executive Steps Rule:** For time-sensitive steps (typical in the action-response phase), the executive steps must be detailed by **time and responsible party**.
10. Content Formatting and Accountability Rules
11. **Directive Language Mandate:** Actions must be short, directive, checkable, and must use **simple words, short sentences, and clear, direct, command-style verbs**. Complex language, long sentences, and ambiguous phrases must be strictly avoided as they lead to confusion and delays under severe psychological pressure.
12. **Table Organization:** The content must be organized in a table format containing the columns: **Action, Status, and Remarks / Report**.
13. **Status Checkability:** Status options must be clear and checkable. For urgent items, status options must include definitive completion steps such as **Executed, Communicated, or Reported**.
14. **Reporting Requirement:** The **Remarks / Report** column is mandatory for entering relevant explanations, detailed statistical reports (e.g., inventory consumption rate, vacant bed counts), or necessary coordination notes.
15. **Execution Confirmation:** A final section for **Execution Confirmation** is mandatory, requiring sign-off by the primary actor or commander, detailing the Full Name, Date & Time, and Signature.
