# Part One: Rules for the Strategic Action Plan (EOP) Framework (Preparedness Phase)

The EOP is the foundational document developed before the incident (Preparedness Phase) that outlines the necessary policies, principles, and guidelines to increase resilience against economic warfare and supply chain paralysis.

1. Foundational Planning and Review Rules
2. **Mandatory Prerequisite Assessment:** The EOP must be developed based on a preceding **Hazard and Safety Assessment** conducted annually, which determines and prioritizes the frequency of hazard occurrence and its level of risk, especially focusing on threat scenarios like economic warfare and intensification of sanctions.
3. **Scope and Approach:** The planning must adopt an **"all-hazards and all-health aspects"** approach, emphasizing flexibility to adapt the plan according to evolving local conditions and specific threats.
4. **Mandatory Annual Review:** The Strategic Response Plan must be **reviewed and revised annually** (typically in the first two weeks of October).
5. **Lessons Learned Integration:** Revision must be based on the systematic recording of **lessons learned** from the previous year's incidents and drills. A formal lessons learned workshop must be held for important incidents within a maximum of two months after the response operation ends.
6. Governing Principles Rules

The plan must rigorously adhere to four fundamental principles:

1. **Principle of Continuity of Operations:** Requires designing systems with high flexibility, creating surplus capacities, and planning for continuity so that the delivery of essential health services is never interrupted.
2. **Principle of Unified Command and Control:** Emphasizes establishing a clear, centralized, and pre-practiced command structure and a transparent chain of command.
3. **Principle of Optimal Resource Utilization:** Mandates that scarce resources (medicines, specialized equipment, foreign currency, personnel, and time) must be allocated based on **scientific logic and prioritization (triage)** to achieve the maximum possible outcome (saving the greatest number of lives).
4. **Principle of Protection of Staff and Patients:** Considers the physical and psychological security and health of healthcare personnel an ethical and strategic imperative, necessary to prevent "service abandonment" due to severe psychological pressure.
5. Command and Legal Preparedness Rules (National Tactical Level)

The Ministry (Level 1) must establish the necessary legal, financial, and command authorities before the sanction intensification occurs.

1. **Commander Designation:** The plan must legally establish the Minister of Health as the **"National Health Operations Commander"**.
2. **Succession Mandate:** The Ministry must mandate all affiliated entities to develop a **"Command Succession Document"** identifying successors for all key positions to ensure the command chain remains uninterrupted by personnel changes.
3. **Judicial Immunity Preparation:** The EOP must seek legal approval to establish **judicial immunity for managers** who make urgent decisions within the framework of crisis protocols, thereby eliminating the "fear of decision-making".
4. **Exemption from Conflicting Laws:** The plan must prepare for the temporary suspension/exemption of laws that impede rapid action, such as the **Public Accounts Law and Public Tender Law** , enabling procurement without tender formalities when sanctions strike.
5. **Financial Green Corridor Planning:** The plan must define the legal requirements for the Central Bank to activate a **"Special Foreign Exchange Credit Line"** for urgent preferential rate imports, providing foreign currency outside regular queues.
6. **Customs Facilitation:** Planning must mandate the creation of a **"Health Green Customs Corridor"** with Customs to ensure 24-hour non-stop clearance of all pharmaceutical and crisis-related raw material shipments, with complete exemption from customs duties.
7. Mandatory Preparedness Functions Implementation Rules (P1-P6)

The EOP must define detailed duties for the following functions, managed primarily by the Ministry Headquarters:

| Function Code | Function Title                            | Duties and Requirements at Ministry Level                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **P1**        | **Strategic Coordination**                | Defining mechanisms for both intra-sectoral and inter-sectoral coordination; holding meetings, drafting, and concluding a **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)** signed by the highest responsible authority of collaborating organizations (e.g., Central Bank). |
| **P2**        | **Safety and Hazard Assessment**          | Conducting an **annual hazard assessment** program for health and treatment facilities and collecting, analyzing, and presenting the resultant report to the higher level. |
| **P3**        | **EOP Development**                       | Systematically recording **lessons learned** from previous incidents/drills and conducting the **annual revision** of the EOP in October. |
| **P4**        | **Stockpiling of Supplies and Equipment** | Preparing a comprehensive **list of required supplies** and materials (especially imported and specialized items restricted by sanctions), developing the relevant protocol, actively stockpiling, and performing **periodic control** of reserves. |
| **P5**        | **Personnel Training**                    | Developing a comprehensive training matrix (basic and specialized training) specifying which level of managers and staff should be trained for which subject, and maintaining a **Crisis Management Training Record** for each staff member. |
| **P6**        | **Personnel Drill**                       | Developing a **drill program** and scenarios (including economic warfare simulation), and maintaining a **Crisis Management Drill Record** for each staff member. |

5. Sanctions-Specific Resource Resilience Rules (Logistics Doctrine)

The EOP must specifically codify rules for a resilient logistics network, given that sanctions primarily target the supply chain and financial infrastructure:

1. **Logistics Command:** The establishment of the **"Health Logistics Command Center (HLC)"** as the logistics brain, responsible for integrated command and supervision of all supply, warehousing, and distribution processes nationwide.
2. **Multi-Layer Reserve Network:** The Ministry must plan for the creation and equipping of at least **3 ultra-secure central warehouses** in geographically dispersed locations to store **6 months country needs** of critical items (e.g., specialized drugs, raw materials).
3. **Regional Hubs:** Creation of approximately **10 regional logistics hubs** to serve as secondary distribution centers, capable of storing **3 months regional needs**.
4. **Integrated Information System:** Deployment of national software (such as the Integrated Reserve Management System or IMS) for **real-time monitoring** of inventory, expiration dates, and item location across the entire warehouse network for intelligent distribution planning.
5. **Domestic Production Support:** Issuing **long-term purchase guarantee contracts** to domestic producers and providing clear guidelines for them to rapidly change production lines to urgently needed crisis items.

# Part Two: Rules for Creating Implementing Checklists (Preparedness Phase)

Checklists serve as executable directives derived from the EOP principles, designed for Managers and Headquarters Experts at the Ministry/University Level, focusing on policy-making and policy implementation procedures.

1. Structural and Definitional Specifications
2. **Target Audience Rule:** Checklists are designed for **Managers and Headquarters Experts** (Ministry/University Level), requiring defined procedures for policy-making and decision-making to expedite coordination.
3. **Mandatory Profile Data:** The document must contain the required profile elements: **Checklist Name**, **Relevant Domain** (e.g., Deputy Ministry of Logistics), **Crisis Scope** (Sanctions), and **Checklist Type** (Preparedness Phase).
4. **Reference Protocols Rule:** Checklists must utilize **higher-level, officially communicated protocols** (national or international documents) and adapt them to the specific organizational structure and crisis conditions.
5. **Role-Based Writing Rule:** Documents must be written for **defined organizational roles** (e.g., Director General of Pharmaceuticals), and **not** for specific individuals (e.g., "Mr. Smith"), ensuring that responsibilities are **clear and unambiguous**.
6. **Role Identification:** The checklist must explicitly define the **Process Owner** (the central department overseeing the protocol), the **Actor(s) / Implementer(s)** (by position/title), and the **Operations Commander**.
7. **Activation Trigger Rule:** Every process must have a **clear and specific trigger** that defines the exact starting point of the operation, preventing premature or delayed responses.
8. **Objective Definition Rule:** The **Checklist Objective** must be defined, representing the final, measurable goal of the execution.
9. **Executive Steps Detailing:** Time-sensitive steps should be detailed by time and responsible party.
10. Content Formatting and Accountability Rules
11. **Directive Language Mandate:** Action language must be simple, using **short sentences and clear, direct, command-style verbs**. Complex language and ambiguous phrases must be strictly avoided as they lead to confusion and delays.
12. **Table Organization:** The executable content must be organized in a table format containing the columns: **Action, Status, and Remarks / Report**.
13. **Status Options Rule:** Status options must be clear and checkable (e.g., **Executed, Communicated, Reported, In Progress, or Not Applicable (N/A)**).
14. **Remarks/Report Mandate:** The **Remarks / Report** column is **mandatory** for entering relevant explanations, detailed statistical reports (e.g., inventory counts), or necessary coordination notes.
15. **Execution Confirmation Rule:** A final section for **sign-off** by the primary actor or commander is mandatory, detailing the Full Name, Date & Time, and Signature.
