The Strategic Response Plan (EOP) is the foundational document developed during the Preparedness Phase (before the incident). It must articulate the principles, policies, and guidelines necessary to increase resilience and ensure the continuity of essential health services under the most severe economic threats.

1. Foundational Planning and Review Rules
2. **Prerequisite: Hazard Assessment:** The EOP must be based on a preceding **Hazard and Safety Assessment** conducted annually, which determines the frequency and level of risk, especially focusing on threat scenarios like economic warfare and intensification of sanctions.
3. **Scenario Scope:** The planning must adopt an **"all-hazards and all-health aspects"** approach, emphasizing flexibility to adapt the plan according to evolving local conditions and specific threats.
4. **Mandatory Annual Review:** The Strategic Response Plan (EOP) must be **reviewed and revised annually** (typically in the first two weeks of October).
5. **Lessons Learned Integration:** Revision must be based on systematically recording **lessons learned** from the previous year's incidents and drills. A formal lessons learned workshop must be held for important incidents within a maximum of two months after the response operation ends.
6. Governing Principles

The action plan must be founded on four non-negotiable principles that must govern all preparatory actions:

1. **Principle of Continuity of Operations:** Requires designing systems with high flexibility, creating surplus capacities, and planning for continuity so that the delivery of essential health services is never interrupted.
2. **Principle of Unified Command and Control:** Emphasizes establishing a clear, centralized, and pre-practiced command structure and a transparent chain of command, crucial for managing system-wide response during complex sanction effects.
3. **Principle of Optimal Resource Utilization:** Mandates that scarce resources (medicines, specialized equipment, foreign currency, and time) must be allocated based on scientific logic and prioritization.
4. **Principle of Protection of Staff and Patients:** Considers the physical and psychological security and health of healthcare personnel an ethical and strategic imperative, necessary to prevent "service abandonment" due to severe psychological pressure.
5. Ministry Level (Tactical) Command and Legal Preparedness Rules

The Ministry Headquarters (Level 1: National Tactical Level) must establish the necessary legal, financial, and command authorities *before* the sanction intensification occurs (Preparedness Phase).

A. Command and Authority Structure

1. **Commander Designation:** The plan must legally establish the Minister of Health as the **"National Health Operations Commander"**.
2. **Succession Mandate:** The Ministry must mandate all affiliated entities to develop a **"Command Succession Document"** identifying successors for all key positions to ensure the command chain remains uninterrupted by personnel changes.
3. **Judicial Immunity Preparation:** The EOP must seek legal approval to establish **judicial immunity for managers** who make urgent decisions within the framework of crisis protocols, eliminating the "fear of decision-making".

B. Financial and Procurement Authorities

1. **Exemption from Conflicting Laws:** The plan must prepare for the **temporary suspension** of laws that impede rapid action, such as the **Public Accounts Law and Public Tender Law**, enabling procurement without tender formalities when sanctions strike.
2. **Financial Green Corridor Planning:** The plan must define the legal requirements for the Central Bank to activate a **"Special Foreign Exchange Credit Line"** for urgent imports, providing foreign currency outside regular queues.
3. **Customs Facilitation:** Planning must mandate the creation of a **"Health Green Customs Corridor"** with Customs to ensure 24-hour non-stop clearance of all pharmaceutical and crisis-related raw material shipments.
4. Mandatory Preparedness Functions (P1-P6)

The EOP must define detailed duties for the following functions, managed primarily by the Ministry Headquarters:

| Function Code | Function Title                   | Duties and Requirements at Ministry Level                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **P1**        | **Strategic Coordination**       | **Intra-sectoral coordination** (within the MoH units) and **inter-sectoral coordination** (with external agencies). Must include holding meetings, drafting, and concluding a **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)** signed by the highest responsible authority of the collaborating organizations (e.g., Ministry of Industry, Central Bank). |
| **P2**        | **Safety and Hazard Assessment** | Conducting an **annual hazard assessment** program for health and treatment facilities and collecting, analyzing, and presenting the resultant report to the higher level. |
| **P3**        | **EOP Development**              | Systematically recording **lessons learned** from previous incidents/drills and conducting the **annual revision** of the EOP in October. |
| **P4**        | **Stockpiling**                  | Preparing a comprehensive **list of required supplies** and materials (especially imported and specialized items restricted by sanctions), developing the relevant protocol, actively stockpiling, and performing **periodic control** of reserves. |
| **P5**        | **Personnel Training**           | Developing a comprehensive training matrix (basic and specialized training) specifying which level of managers and staff should be trained for which subject, and maintaining a **Crisis Management Training Record** for each staff member. |
| **P6**        | **Personnel Drill**              | Developing a **drill program** and scenarios (including economic warfare simulation), and maintaining a **Crisis Management Drill Record** for each staff member. |

5. Supply Chain and Logistics Doctrine (Sanctions Specific)

As sanctions target the supply chain, the EOP must specifically codify rules for a resilient logistics network (Protocol 2.5, 2.6):

1. **Multi-Layer Reserve Network:** The Ministry must plan for the creation and equipping of at least **3 ultra-secure central warehouses** in geographically dispersed locations to store **6 months country needs** of critical items (e.g., specialized drugs, raw materials).
2. **Regional Hubs:** Creation of approximately **10 regional logistics hubs** to serve as secondary distribution centers, capable of storing **3 months regional needs**.
3. **Logistics Command:** The establishment of the **"Health Logistics Command Center (HLC)"** as the logistics brain, responsible for integrated command and supervision of all supply, warehousing, and distribution processes nationwide.
4. **Integrated Information System:** Deployment of national software (such as the Integrated Reserve Management System or IMS) for **real-time monitoring** of inventory, expiration dates, and item location across the entire warehouse network for intelligent distribution planning.
5. **Domestic Production Support:** Issuing **long-term purchase guarantee contracts** to domestic producers and providing clear guidelines for them to rapidly change production lines to urgently needed crisis items.
