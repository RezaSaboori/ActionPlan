The development of a comprehensive action plan is stratified into strategic planning (before the incident, resulting in an EOP) and operational planning (after the incident, resulting in an IAP).

1. Definition and Review Sequence of Plans

| Plan Type                         | Time Phase                         | Definition and Purpose                                       | Review Requirement                                           | Responsible Unit                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Strategic Response Plan (EOP)** | Before the Incident (Preparedness) | States the policies, principles, and guidelines for response operations, serving as the foundation for action. | Annually.                                                    | Planning section of the Incident Command System (ICS).       |
| **Incident Action Plan (IAP)**    | After the Incident (Response)      | A dynamic written document that operationalizes the EOP by determining objectives and tactics for a specific affected area. | Reviewed hourly or daily, depending on successive damage and needs assessment reports. | Planning section of the ICS, approved by the Incident Commander. |

The action plan must be derived from the Hazard and Safety Assessment conducted annually, which determines and prioritizes the frequency and risk level of threats.

2. Ministry Level (National Tactical) Command and Operational Rules

As the National Health Crisis Operations Command Center, the Ministry level plan must incorporate rules concerning command, coordination, and resource management.

A. Command and Authority

1. **Unified Command System (ICS):** The action plan must be developed and implemented within a unified command structure (Incident Command System or ICS) to ensure coordination and prevent overlapping duties.
2. **Commander Identification:** The Ministry's action plan must specify that the Minister of Health is the "National Health Operations Commander".
3. **Succession Documentation:** The plan must incorporate rules requiring the development and communication of a "Command Succession Document" which mandates identifying successors for all key management positions to ensure command continuity.
4. **Authority Utilization:** The plan must define the utilization of special, legally acquired authorities, such as the ability to purchase without tender formalities, relocate personnel/resources nationwide, and issue binding directives.

B. Core Functions and Responsibilities

The Ministry Headquarters (HQ) plan should define duties for strategic policy-making, resource management, and setting standards:

1. **Policy Development:** The HQ is responsible for the development and issuance of standards, protocols, and technical and clinical guidelines.
2. **Strategic Resource Management:** Functions related to the establishment, management, and distribution of national strategic reserves (e.g., medicines, specialized kits) must be planned.
3. **Coordination Mandate:** The Ministry is responsible for intra-sectoral coordination (within the health ministry units) and inter-sectoral coordination (with external agencies like Defense or Energy). The Strategic Coordination function involves holding meetings and concluding Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with stakeholders during the preparedness phase.
4. **Integrated Information System:** Rules must be established for implementing an integrated command, control, and information system for intelligent crisis management and real-time monitoring of strategic reserves.
5. IAP Development Principles (Post-Incident Operationalization)

The IAP provides specific actions based on the verified damage.

A. Pre-requisites for IAP Development

1. **News Verification:** Development begins only after verifying news from peripheral sources and media. The verified news is then communicated to activate the ICS.
2. **Assessment Data:** The IAP must be developed based on the results of the Damage and Needs Assessment. For the health system, this involves a Joint Rapid Assessment conducted within the first possible time (preferably not more than 24 hours after the incident).
3. **Situational Awareness:** Continuous situational awareness must be maintained through periodic assessments and Situation Reports (SitRep) to inform revisions of the IAP.

B. Setting Operational Objectives

1. **Objectives Definition:** Objectives must be clear, operational, measurable, and achievable.
2. **Basis for Objectives:** Objectives must be determined based on the specific damages, immediate needs, available resources, and the prevailing social and political conditions of the incident.
3. **Coverage:** To ensure completeness, the action plan must determine relevant objectives for *each* response phase function (managerial, specific, and specialized).
4. **Format:** Objectives must state the main action, its location, and the time of implementation.
5. **Participatory Process:** The responsibility for developing the IAP rests with the Planning section of the ICS, involving participation from all relevant operational units.

C. Content and Functions

The Ministry's action plan must detail managerial and specific functions necessary for the response, including:

1. **Warning and News Verification:** Establishing a 24/7 process for receiving and analyzing news from hazard monitoring centers and announcing warning levels (Yellow/Advisory, Orange/Standby, Red/Action).
2. **Personnel Call-up:** Defining the crisis on-call plan, creating a personnel contact database, and implementing the required call-up based on need.
3. **Support and Continuity:** Planning for the provision of specialized support services, including safe service delivery space, supplies, accommodation, electricity, transportation, communication means, and emergency funds, acknowledging that standard peacetime procedures are too slow for crisis operations.
4. **Communication:** Preparing a multi-layered communication plan (e.g., satellite, radio, etc.) and communication protocol to ensure continuity despite infrastructure damage.
5. **Performance Monitoring and Evaluation:** Incorporating rules for post-incident evaluation (AAR) and continuous improvement based on monitoring results, objectives, job descriptions, and standards.
