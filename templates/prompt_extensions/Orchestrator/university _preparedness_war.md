The Strategic Response Plan (EOP) is the foundational policy document developed during the Preparedness Phase (before the incident) that outlines the necessary policies, principles, and guidelines for future response operations.

1. Foundational Planning and Review Rules
2. **Prerequisite: Hazard Assessment Mandate:** The EOP development must be preceded by an annual **Hazard and Safety Assessment** to determine and prioritize the frequency of hazard occurrence and its level of risk. This assessment, specific to health and treatment facilities, must be conducted annually (e.g., in October) and its results reported to the higher level.
3. **Scope and Scenario:** The plan must be designed with an **"all-hazards and all-health aspects"** approach, emphasizing flexibility to adapt the scenario to local conditions.
4. **Governing Strategy:** The primary strategy of the plan must be the transformation of healthcare facilities from vulnerable entities to **self-sufficient and resilient fortresses** through an integrated and systemic approach.
5. **Review and Revision Mandate:** The Strategic Response Plan (EOP) must be **reviewed and revised annually** (e.g., in the first two weeks of October). Revisions must incorporate the systematic recording of **lessons learned** from the previous year's incidents and drills.
6. Governing Principles

All actions and protocols developed by the University EOC must adhere to four fundamental principles:

1. **Principle of Continuity of Operations:** Ensuring that the delivery of essential health services is not interrupted under any circumstances, achieved through flexibility, creation of surplus capacities, and planning for severe crisis scenarios.
2. **Principle of Unified Command and Control:** Emphasizing the necessity of having a clear, centralized command structure that is pre-designed and practiced, preventing confusion and contradictory orders.
3. **Principle of Optimal Resource Utilization:** Mandating that scarce resources (personnel, medicines, equipment, and time) must be allocated based on scientific logic and prioritization to achieve the maximum possible outcome.
4. **Principle of Protection of Staff and Patients:** Considering the physical and psychological security and health of healthcare personnel as an ethical and strategic imperative on par with treating patients.
5. Command and Operational Structure Rules

As the operational level, the University plan must establish clear authority and command chains for effective local execution.

1. **ICS Implementation:** The plan must mandate the use of the **Incident Command System (ICS)** model to ensure unified command structure within the university and affiliated centers.
2. **Commander Identification:** The University President/Hospital Director is designated as the **Scene Commander** or **Operations Commander** at this level, operating from the University/Hospital Crisis Operations Command Center (EOC/Health War Room).
3. **Succession Documentation:** The University is obligated to develop and communicate the **"Command Succession Document"** identifying successors for all key responsibilities (e.g., university president, hospital director, head nurses) to ensure the command chain is never interrupted. The University Commander typically appoints the Deputy for Treatment as their successor, and the Deputy for Health as the second successor.
4. **Contingency Authority Delegation:** The plan must incorporate mechanisms for the delegation of authorities, ensuring that the Scene Commander has the authority to implement protocols, manage local resources, and potentially unify management of local medical centers in catastrophic conditions (Code Red 2 or Purple Status), even if communication with the Ministry is cut off.
5. Preparedness Levels and Triggers (Code Status)

The plan must define clear actions for the staged activation of resources based on codified threat levels:

• **White Status (Sustained Readiness):** Defines actions for normal conditions, focusing on EOP development, training, continuous drills (at least quarterly), and provision/regular rotation of strategic reserves (100% defined level).

• **Yellow Status (Warning and Alert):** Defined as conditions where military or political tensions have increased. Mandatory actions include:

  ◦ Limited, 24-hour activation of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC).

  ◦ Immediate inventory review to bring all strategic and consumable reserves to **120% of defined capacity**.

  ◦ Alert of rapid response teams and final infrastructure review (hot testing generators, backup communication).

  ◦ **Reduction of elective surgeries** to keep inpatient and intensive care beds available.

Mandatory Preparatory Functions (P1-P6) Rules: The University is responsible for scheduling, implementing, and reporting on all mandatory preparedness functions, integrating them into the existing organizational structure.

P1: Strategic Coordination Rule

The University must implement strategic coordination at the local level (inter-sectoral):

1. **Stakeholder Identification:** Participation in the analysis and identification of stakeholders necessary for general and specific functions.
2. **MOU Conclusion:** Drafting a **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)** clearly stating roles and responsibilities with local and regional external partners (e.g., local police, private hospitals, utilities).
3. **Reporting:** If an MOU is signed at the university level, a copy must be sent to the Ministry of Health.

P2: Safety and Hazard Assessment Rule

1. **Annual Execution:** Conduct an **annual hazard assessment** of health and treatment facilities.
2. **Data Management:** Collect and analyze hazard assessment data.
3. **Reporting:** Prepare and present the hazard assessment report to the higher level.

P3: EOP Development Rule

1. **Systematic Recording of Lessons Learned:** Participate in the systematic recording of lessons learned from previous incidents and drills.
2. **AAR Workshop:** Participate in holding a **lessons learned workshop** for important incidents within a maximum of two months after the end of the response operation.
3. **EOP Revision:** Participate in the revision of the EOP in October of each year, ensuring adaptation of the national plan to local university conditions.

P4: Stockpiling Rule

1. **Needs Listing:** Participate in preparing a list of required supplies and materials.
2. **Protocol Compliance:** Implement protocols for stockpiling, provision, and maintenance of strategic supplies and materials.
3. **Multi-Level Storage Model:** Implement the multi-level storage model:

  ◦ **Level 1 (Operational Reserve):** Maintain **14 days'** crisis consumption needs in critical departments (emergency, OT, ICU).

  ◦ **Level 2 (Hospital Reserve):** Maintain **30 days'** needs of strategic items (broad-spectrum antibiotics, trauma kits) in a secure hospital warehouse.

  ◦ **Level 3 (Provincial/University Reserve):** Maintain **90 days'** needs of very critical and specialized items (antidotes, biological drugs) in the university central warehouse.

4. **Control:** Perform periodic control of stockpiles.

P5 & P6: Personnel Training and Drill Rules

1. **Training Matrix Implementation:** Implement training programs based on the disaster management training matrix, ensuring that all health and treatment personnel receive necessary training related to their field, including specialized clinical training (e.g., trauma management).
2. **Record Keeping:** Maintain a **Crisis Management Training Record** and a **Crisis Management Drill Record** for each staff member.
3. **Drill Execution:** Execute a diverse and integrated **drill program** (e.g., quarterly drills) to evaluate plans and improve skills (e.g., simulating production system failure or full HIS network interruption).
