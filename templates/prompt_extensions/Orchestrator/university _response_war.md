The IAP is the operational document developed *after* a war incident (such as military engagement or attack) to define immediate objectives and tactics based on local damage and needs.

1. Foundational Planning and Contextual Rules
2. **Prerequisite and Basis:** The development of the IAP is predicated on the completion of a **Damage and Needs Assessment** (SitRep), which determines the extent, scope of damage, and available resources after the incident.
3. **Timing and Review:** The IAP development begins as soon as the first Situation Report is received from the affected area. The IAP is a dynamic document and must be **reviewed hourly or daily** depending on successive damage and needs assessment reports and changes in the affected area. The duration of the IAP is equivalent to the duration of the response operation.
4. **Level of Development:** The IAP is developed at the determined level of the incident (e.g., provincial or county level). If other university units are present at the site, the resulting IAP is a "field plan" or part of a **joint IAP** of the incident.
5. **Planning Responsibility:** The responsibility for developing the IAP lies with the **Planning section** of the Incident Command System (ICS) and requires approval from the **Incident Commander**. The development process must be participatory, involving representatives from all relevant operational units.
6. Command, Authority, and Operational Structure Rules

The IAP must reflect the unified command structure and the special delegation of authority granted to the regional commander during a crisis.

A. Unified Command and Succession

1. **ICS Mandate:** All operations defined in the IAP must adhere to the **Unified Command Structure (ICS)** model to ensure coordination and prevent the overlap of duties and functions.
2. **Commander Identification:** The University President or Hospital Director is the designated **Scene Commander** (or Regional Operations Commander) at the Operational Level, operating from the Hospital Crisis Operations Command Center (EOC/Health War Room).
3. **Succession Documentation:** The IAP must incorporate rules ensuring the **Command Succession Document** is actively used, identifying successors for all key positions (e.g., hospital director to ward head nurse) to prevent command interruption. The University Commander (President) appoints the Deputy for Treatment as their successor, and the Deputy for Health as the second successor.

B. Delegation of Emergency Authority (Scene Commander)

The IAP must authorize the use of special delegated authorities necessary for immediate response.

1. **Resource Mobilization:** The Scene Commander has full authority over all health resources (governmental and private) within their geographical jurisdiction.
2. **Operational Changes:** Authority includes modifying shift schedules, canceling leave, and **changing the designated use of wards** (e.g., converting an internal medicine ward to a trauma ward) without requiring authorization from a higher level.
3. **Emergency Procurement:** Authority is granted for **emergency procurement of vital items** from any available source, outside tender procedures.
4. **Extreme Authority (Code Purple/Red 2):** If the incident is severe, and the University EOC loses communication with the National Command Center (Ministry) for a period exceeding 6 hours, the University President, acting as the **field commander,** has **full authority** to implement all necessary protocols, relocate resources, emergency recruit, and unify management of all local medical centers (governmental, private, military, and non-governmental). This authority remains until stable communication is re-established.
5. Rules for Setting Operational Objectives (IAP Content)

The IAP transforms the general principles of resilience into specific, executable objectives based on real-time assessments of the war damages.

1. **Basis and Scope:** Objectives must be determined based on the damages, needs, available resources, and the specific social and political consequences of the incident. They must cover objectives for **each response phase function** (managerial, specific, and specialized functions) to ensure comprehensive response.
2. **Measurability and Format:** Objectives must be **clear, operational, measurable, and achievable**. The objective must specify **the main action, its location, and time of implementation**. The method of implementation and the responsible person/group are *not* stated in the objective itself.
3. **Continuous Revision:** Objectives must become gradually more accurate as continuous assessments provide more accurate information over time.
4. Rules for Action Implementation (IAP Development Table)

The IAP Development Table is the final execution document, detailing specific steps to achieve the objectives.

1. **Situational Awareness:** The plan development process must begin with ensuring continuous **Situation Awareness** based on repeated assessments, as conditions in the affected area constantly change.
2. **Plan Development:** Based on the defined objectives, the plan determines **what action should be taken, by which person or group, and at what time**, for each objective in each geographical-functional unit.
3. **Continuous Revision:** The IAP must be continuously revised based on the results obtained from assessments in the affected area, often requiring coordination meetings.
