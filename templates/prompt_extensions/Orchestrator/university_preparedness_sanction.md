The Strategic Response Plan (EOP) is developed during the Preparedness Phase (before the incident) and outlines the policies, principles, and guidelines necessary to increase resilience against economic warfare and supply chain paralysis caused by sanctions.

1. Foundational Planning and Review Rules
2. **Mandatory Prerequisite Assessment:** EOP development must be preceded by a **Hazard and Safety Assessment** to determine and prioritize the frequency of hazard occurrence and its level of risk. This assessment must be conducted annually.
3. **Plan Definition and Type:** The document is defined as the Strategic Response Plan (EOP), which states the principles, policies, and guidelines for response operations.
4. **Strategic Philosophy:** The plan's main strategy must be the transformation of healthcare facilities from vulnerable entities to **self-sufficient and resilient fortresses** through an integrated and systemic approach.
5. **Governing Principles:** All EOP protocols must be founded on four fundamental principles:

  ◦ **Principle of Continuity of Operations:** Ensuring essential health services are never interrupted.

  ◦ **Principle of Unified Command and Control:** Emphasizing a clear, centralized, and pre-practiced command structure.

  ◦ **Principle of Optimal Resource Utilization:** Mandating that scarce resources (like medicines or time) must be allocated based on scientific logic and prioritization to achieve the maximum possible outcome (saving the greatest number of lives).

  ◦ **Principle of Protection of Staff and Patients:** Ensuring the physical and psychological security and health of healthcare personnel as a strategic imperative.

5. **Review and Revision Mandate:** The EOP must be **reviewed and revised annually**. The revision must be based on the systematic recording of **lessons learned** from the previous year's incidents and drills.
6. **Approach:** The plan must utilize an **"all-hazards and all-health aspects"** approach, providing flexibility to adapt the scenario to local conditions.
7. Command and Operational Structure Rules (Level 2)

As the Regional Operational Level (Level 2), the University Headquarters must define command procedures to ensure localized implementation of national protocols.

1. **Command Structure:** The University Headquarters must form and operate within the **Incident Command System (ICS)** model, acting as the executive arm on the frontline. The Crisis Operations Command Center (EOC) at this level is commanded by the university president or hospital director.
2. **Succession Documentation:** The plan must mandate the development and communication of the **"Command Succession Document"** identifying successors for all key responsibilities (e.g., hospital director to ward head nurse) to ensure command continuity.
3. **Authority Definition:** The plan must define the utilization of delegated authorities necessary during a crisis, such as the Scene Commander's authority to modify shift schedules, cancel leave, and perform emergency procurement of vital items from any available source, outside tender procedures.
4. **Definition of Catastrophic Authority (Code Purple/Red 2):** The plan must include protocols detailing that in a catastrophic scenario (e.g., complete loss of communication with the Ministry for more than 6 hours), the University President acts as **field commander with full authority** to manage all regional healthcare facilities (governmental, private, military) and make decisions for resource relocation and recruitment without central authorization.
5. Mandatory Preparedness Functions (P1-P6)

The University Headquarters must perform the following six strategic preparedness functions derived from the EOP guidelines:

| Function Code | Function Title                            | University/Collaborating Unit Duties and Requirements        |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **P1**        | **Strategic Coordination**                | Participation in stakeholder analysis, drafting MOUs, and holding coordination meetings (both intra-sectoral and inter-sectoral). If an MOU is signed at the university level, a copy must be sent to the Ministry of Health. |
| **P2**        | **Safety and Hazard Assessment**          | **Conducting an annual hazard assessment** of health and treatment facilities and participating in preparing and presenting the hazard assessment report to the higher level. |
| **P3**        | **EOP Development**                       | Participation in the systematic recording of lessons learned, participation in holding a **lessons learned workshop** for important incidents, and participation in the **annual revision of the EOP** (in October). |
| **P4**        | **Stockpiling of Supplies and Equipment** | Participation in preparing the list of required supplies/materials, active stockpiling, and periodic control of reserves. This includes implementing the **Multi-Level Storage Model**. |
| **P5**        | **Personnel Training**                    | Scheduling and implementing training programs based on the disaster management training matrix, evaluating training effectiveness, and ensuring each staff member has a **Crisis Management Training Record**. |
| **P6**        | **Personnel Drill**                       | Participation in developing the drill program and scenarios, developing drill evaluation protocols, and ensuring each staff member has a **Crisis Management Drill Record**. |

4. Sanctions-Specific Resource Management Rules (Level 2)

Given that sanctions primarily target the supply chain and financial infrastructure, the University's EOP must include rules for ensuring local resilience (Level 3 responsibilities implemented by Level 2):

1. **Warehouse Creation Obligation:** Each affiliated hospital is obligated to create or equip a **secure, disaster-resistant warehouse** with controlled environmental conditions for strategic reserve storage (Hospital Crisis Warehouse Creation Obligation).
2. **Multi-Level Storage Model Implementation:** The plan must adhere to the national storage doctrine, requiring three levels of strategic reserve maintenance:

  ◦ **Level 1 (Operational Reserve):** 14 days' crisis consumption needs in critical departments (e.g., emergency, ICU).

  ◦ **Level 2 (Hospital Reserve):** 30 days' needs of strategic items (e.g., broad-spectrum antibiotics) in a secure hospital warehouse.

  ◦ **Level 3 (Provincial/University Reserve):** 90 days' needs of very critical and specialized items (e.g., antidotes, biological drugs) in the university central warehouse.

3. **Resource Triage Committee:** The University Headquarters must mandate the formation of a **"Resource Triage Committee"** (consisting of physician, pharmacist, nurse, and manager) to develop internal guidelines for optimal consumption management and fair allocation of scarce resources during a crisis.
4. **Local Supplier Identification:** The plan must require the creation of a list of reliable pharmaceutical and equipment suppliers at the provincial level and the execution of framework contracts with them to accelerate crisis-time purchases.
5. **Source Diversification:** The plan must mandate the identification of at least **two alternative supply sources** for each critical item to reduce dependency risk.
