The IAP is the dynamic, written document created *after* the intensification of sanctions (the incident) to address how to operationalize the high-level Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) in the specific affected regional area.

- Foundational Context and Plan Review Rules
- **Prerequisite Assessment:** The IAP must be developed based on the results of the **Damage and Needs Assessment** (Situation Report or SitRep), which determines the extent and scope of damage (e.g., paralyzing supply chain effects) and available resources.
- **Timing and Review:** IAP development starts as soon as the first Situation Report is received. It is a dynamic document that must be **reviewed hourly or daily** depending on successive damage and needs assessment reports and changes in the affected area. The IAP's duration is equivalent to the duration of the response operation.
- **Planning Responsibility:** The IAP is the responsibility of the **Planning section** of the Incident Command System (ICS) and requires approval from the **Incident Commander**.
- **Participatory Development:** The IAP development must be a participatory process involving the planning representatives of all relevant **geographical-functional units** (e.g., environmental health management unit in a specific county).
- **Plan Development Sequence:** The operational planning must follow a staged sequence: Situation Awareness, Formation of the Plan Development Team, Development of Operation Objectives, Plan Development (determining action, person/group, and time), Plan Approval/Communication, Plan Dissemination, Plan Implementation, and Continuous Plan Revision.
- Command, Authority, and Coordination Rules

The University operates under the Unified Command and Control principle, ensuring a clear and pre-practiced command structure.

- **Unified Command (ICS):** All operations must adhere to the **Incident Command System (ICS)** model to ensure unified command and prevent overlap of duties.
- **Commander Designation:** The University President or Hospital Director serves as the **Scene Commander** or **Operations Commander** at the operational level, directing activities from the University/Hospital Crisis Operations Command Center (EOC).
- **Command Succession Mandate:** The IAP must utilize the existing **Command Succession Document**, which formally identifies successors for all key responsibilities (e.g., Hospital Director to Head Nurse) to prevent interruption of the command chain.
- **Operational Authority Utilization (Emergency Powers):** The IAP must authorize the Scene Commander (Hospital Director) to immediately use delegated legal authorities to ensure service continuity, such as:

  ◦ Emergency procurement of vital items from any available source, **outside tender procedures**.

  ◦ Changing the designated use of wards (e.g., converting a non-critical unit into a specialized shortage storage ward) without requiring authorization.

5. **Catastrophic Authority (Code Purple/Red 2):** The IAP must include rules stating that if communication with the National Command Center (Ministry) is lost for more than six hours, the University President, acting as the **field commander,** has **full authority** to implement all necessary protocols, manage all regional healthcare facilities (governmental, private, military), and make immediate decisions regarding resource relocation and purchase without formalities until communication is re-established.
6. **Operational Coordination:** Coordination between units (intra-sectoral) and external agencies (inter-sectoral) during the response phase must be managed through the **Joint IAP** developed by the ICS. This requires timely sharing of information through consecutive situation reports (SitRep) and holding daily coordination meetings.
7. Rules for Setting Operational Objectives (IAP Content)

The IAP's objectives must translate strategic policies into specific, measurable actions based on the impact of sanctions (e.g., specific supply shortages).

1. **Basis for Objectives:** Objectives must be determined based on the **damages, needs, available resources**, and the specific social and political conditions of the sanction incident.
2. **Measurability and Format:** Objectives must be **clear, operational, measurable, and achievable**. They must state the **main action, its location, and the time of implementation**.
3. **Exclusion of Method:** The IAP objectives must *not* state the method of implementation or the responsible person/group.
4. **Scope Coverage:** To ensure a comprehensive response, objectives must be determined for **each response phase function** (managerial, specific, and specialized).
5. **Focus on Resource Triage:** Objectives must align with the **Principle of Optimal Resource Utilization**, mandating that allocation of scarce resources must be based on scientific logic to achieve maximum outcome. The University must form a **Resource Triage Committee** to develop internal guidelines for optimal consumption management.
6. Rules for Execution (Operational Implementation)

The University is responsible for direct implementation and resource management according to the Multi-Level Storage Model.

**Logistics Implementation:** The IAP must trigger actions for implementing the **Multi-Level Storage Model** across affiliated facilities to manage sanctions-driven shortages:

**Level 1 (Operational Reserve):** Maintain **14 days** of crisis consumption needs in critical departments (emergency, OT, ICU).

**Level 2 (Hospital Reserve):** Maintain **30 days** of needs of strategic items (e.g., antibiotics, anesthesia drugs) in a secure hospital warehouse.

**Level 3 (Provincial/University Reserve):** Maintain **90 days** of needs of very critical and specialized items (e.g., antidotes, biological drugs) in the university central warehouse.

2. **Information System Continuity:** The IAP must mandate actions to manage digital system failure due to potential infrastructure collapse:

  ◦ Immediate implementation of the **"local/offline operation mode"** for critical processes like admission and service registration.

  ◦ Utilization of the **National Paper Record Crisis Kit** (standardized forms for all clinical processes) for uniform use nationwide when digital systems fail.

3. **Performance Monitoring:** The IAP implementation requires continuous performance monitoring and evaluation. This includes collecting daily reports from all units and comparing the actions taken against the functions required by the incident.
