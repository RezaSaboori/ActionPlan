## Part One: Rules for the Incident Action Plan (IAP) Framework (Response Phase)

- **IAP Definition and Purpose:** The IAP is a dynamic written document developed *after* the incident (warfare commencement, attack occurrence) to operationalize the overarching Strategic Response Plan (EOP) within the specific affected area.
- **Prerequisite Data:** IAP development must be based on the results of the **Damage and Needs Assessment** (SitRep), which determines the extent, scope of damage, available resources, and needs after the incident occurs.
- **Timing and Review:** The IAP development begins as soon as the first Situation Report is received from the affected area. It must be **reviewed hourly or daily** depending on successive damage and needs assessment reports and changes in the affected area, as its time period is equivalent to the duration of the response operation.
- **Operational Structure:** The IAP must guide actions taken within the framework of the **Hospital Crisis Operations Command Center (EOC)** and must adhere strictly to the **Unified Command Structure (ICS)** model to ensure coordination.
- **Plan Development Responsibility:** The development of the IAP is the responsibility of the **Planning section** of the ICS, guided by the Incident Command, and requires the participation of all relevant operational units.
- Command, Authority, and Succession Rules (Hospital Level)

The Hospital Director acts as the **Scene Commander** and must utilize specialized delegated authorities to overcome bureaucratic obstacles during the response.

- **Commander Identification:** The Hospital Director, acting from the EOC (recognized as the **health war room**), is the designated **Scene Commander** or **Commander of Operations** at the unit level.

- **Succession Mandate:** The IAP must reflect the utilization of the **Command Succession Document** to ensure that command continuity is maintained even if the unit head is eliminated or incapacitated. The successor is typically the coordinator of the unit's crisis management committee.

- **Code Activation Rules:** The IAP is activated upon the declaration of **Code Red** (Active Crisis) or **Purple Status (Red 2)** (Catastrophic Crisis).

  -   **Code Red Authorities:** The Scene Commander has the authority for immediate actions, including **modifying shift schedules and canceling leave**, **changing the designated use of wards** (e.g., converting a non-clinical space to a trauma ward) without requiring higher authorization, and **emergency procurement of vital items** outside tender procedures.

  -   **Purple Status/Red 2 Authority Rule:** If the hospital loses communication with the University EOC for an extended period (more than 6 hours), the Hospital Director acts as the **field commander with full authority** to implement all necessary protocols, manage resources, and decide on emergency recruitment and purchase without formalities until stable communication is re-established.

- **Operational Coordination:** The IAP must define mechanisms for coordination. This includes timely sharing of information through consecutive Situation Reports (SitRep) and participating in daily coordination meetings with the university EOC.
- Rules for Setting Operational Objectives (IAP Content)

- The IAP must transform generic war preparedness into concrete, locally relevant objectives based on the current damages (e.g., loss of infrastructure, mass casualties).

- **Basis and Scope:** Objectives must be determined based on local damages, needs, available resources, and covering objectives for **each response phase function** (managerial, specific, and specialized functions).
- **Clarity and Measurability:** Objectives must be **clear, operational, measurable, and achievable**.
- **Format Rule:** Objectives must state **the main action, its location (e.g., specific ward/area), and the time of implementation**. The method of implementation or the responsible person/group are *not* stated in the objective itself.
  - *Example Objective:* Evacuating the injured from section A of the affected county B by hour.

- **Clinical Focus:** Objectives must support the paradigm shift to **population-centered medicine**. This includes objectives for:
- **Capacity Expansion (Surge Capacity):** Utilization of adaptive capacities and alternative spaces within the hospital (e.g., Level 2 Activation objectives).
- **Resource Triage:** Implementation of protocols for **Optimal Resource Utilization** (triage) to ensure critical resources are allocated for maximum possible outcome.
-  **Damage Control Surgery:** Activation of protocols for staged, rapid surgery aimed at preserving life for transfer to ICU.
- IAP Development Table Rules
  - The IAP Development Table is the final execution document that determines the detailed steps for achieving the objectives.
  - **Information Flow:** The plan must determine **what action should be taken, by which person or group, and at what time**, for each objective in each geographical-functional unit.
  - **Required Documentation:** All actions and financial expenditures must be accurately recorded and documented in summary and reasoned form (even in audio, text message, or handwritten form in the EOC logbook) for post-crisis accountability.
  - **Reporting:** The IAP must include rules for the operational teams to provide information on the incident and actions taken based on determined checklists to the specific unit. Continuous monitoring and evaluation requires collecting daily reports from all units and comparing actions taken with required functions.

## Part Two: Rules for Creating Implementing Checklists

Checklists are essential tools for **Frontline Implementers and Staff** (Level 3) during the response phase, designed to facilitate rapid, directive actions under severe psychological pressure.

1. Structural and Definitional Specifications
2. **Target Audience:** Checklists are designed for **Frontline Implementers and Staff** (e.g., Triage nurse, facilities technical staff), requiring a tool that is fast, directive, and free of extraneous details.
3. **Mandatory Profile Data****:** The document must specify:

  ◦ **Checklist Name:** Defined according to the main guideline document.

  ◦ **Relevant Domain:** The relevant directorate or organization (e.g., Deputy Ministry of Treatment).

  ◦ **Crisis Scope:** Must specify **War / Mass Casualty Incidents**.

  ◦ **Checklist Type:** Must specify the **Action-Response Phase**.

3. **Reference Protocols Rule:** Checklists must be developed using protocols referenced in the Comprehensive Plan, localizing and adapting **higher-level, officially communicated protocols** (national directives) to the specific **capabilities and structure of the nation's hospitals** (e.g., roles of supervisors, environmental health units, etc.).
4. **Role-Based Writing Rule:** Checklists must be written for **defined organizational roles** (e.g., Hospital Director, Facilities Manager, Nursing Supervisor), **not** for specific individuals. Responsibilities must be **clear and unambiguous** to ensure continuity.
5. **Role Identification:** Must explicitly define the **Process Owner**, the **Actor(s)/Implementer(s)** (by position/title), and the **Operations Commander**.
6. Pre-Action Parameters
7. **Activation Trigger:** Every process must have a **clear and specific trigger** that defines the exact starting point of the operation (e.g., "Activate this process upon the declaration of 'Code Red'" or a specific infrastructure failure like "nationwide power outage lasting more than 30 minutes").
8. **Checklist Objective:** Defines the final, measurable goal of the checklist's execution.
9. **Executive Step Detailing:** For time-sensitive steps (typical in the action-response phase), the executive steps must be detailed by **time and responsible party**.
10. Content Formatting and Style Rules
11. **Directive Language Mandate:** Action language must be simple, using **short sentences and clear, direct, command-style verbs**. Complex language, long sentences, and ambiguous phrases must be avoided, as they lead to confusion and delays under severe psychological pressure.
12. **Content Alignment:** Actions must be aligned with executive directives and protocols.
13. **Table Organization:** The executive content should be organized in a table format containing at least the columns for **Action, Status, and Remarks / Report**.
14. **Status Options:** Status options should be configured based on the action type and must be clear and checkable (e.g., **Executed, Communicated, Reported** for urgent items).
15. **Reporting Requirement:** The **Remarks / Report** column is mandatory for entering relevant explanations, detailed statistical reports (e.g., vacant bed counts), or necessary coordination notes.
16. Accountability Rule
17. **Execution Confirmation:** A final section for **Execution Confirmation** is mandatory, requiring sign-off by the primary actor or commander, including the **Full Name, Date & Time, and Signature**.
