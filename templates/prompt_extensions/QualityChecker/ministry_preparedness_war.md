# Part One: Rules for Strategic Action Plan (EOP) Framework and Context

The Strategic Response Plan (EOP) is developed in the Preparedness Phase (before the incident) and outlines the necessary policies, principles, and guidelines for future response operations.

1. Foundational Planning Rules
2. **Prerequisite: Hazard Assessment:** The EOP must be preceded by an annual **Hazard and Safety Assessment** to determine and prioritize the frequency of hazard occurrence and its level of risk. The assessment also includes developing scenarios of hazard occurrence and related damages so that planning is based on conditions close to reality.
3. **Scope and Approach:** The plan must be designed with an **"all-hazards and all-health aspects"** approach, emphasizing flexibility to adapt the scenario to local conditions.
4. **Review and Revision:** The Strategic Response Plan (EOP) must be formally **reviewed and revised annually**. Revision must be based on lessons learned from the previous year's incidents and drills.
5. **Transformation Strategy:** The main strategy of the document must be the transformation of healthcare facilities from vulnerable entities to **self-sufficient and resilient fortresses** through an integrated and systemic approach.
6. Governing Principles

The action plan must be founded on four fundamental principles that govern all actions and protocols:

1. **Principle of Continuity of Operations:** Ensuring that the delivery of essential health services is not interrupted under any circumstances, achieved through flexibility, creation of surplus capacities, and planning for severe crisis scenarios.
2. **Principle of Unified Command and Control:** Emphasizing the existence of a clear, centralized, and pre-practiced command structure to prevent confusion and contradictory orders, requiring the precise definition of authorities and responsibilities.
3. **Principle of Optimal Resource Utilization:** Mandating that scarce resources (human resources, medicines, equipment, blood, and time) must be allocated based on scientific logic and prioritization to achieve the maximum possible outcome.
4. **Principle of Protection of Staff and Patients:** Considering the physical and psychological security and health of healthcare personnel as an ethical and strategic imperative on par with treating patients.
5. Ministry Level (Tactical) Command and Policy Rules

As the National Health Crisis Operations Command Center, the Ministry plan must focus on centralized leadership, resource allocation, and policy development.

A. Authority and Legal Framework (Protocol 8.1 & 8.2)

1. **Supreme Command Designation:** The plan must legally establish the Minister of Health as the **"Commander-in-Chief of Health Operations in Crisis,"** possessing full authority to mobilize all public and private sector resources, change the designated use of spaces, and issue binding directives.
2. **Judicial Immunity:** The plan must seek the approval of legislation to establish **judicial immunity for managers** and personnel who make urgent decisions within the framework of the protocols to eliminate the "fear of decision-making".
3. **Financial Exemptions:** The plan must define mechanisms for obtaining legal authority for emergency procurement, including temporary suspension of laws that impede speed, such as the **Public Accounts Law and Public Tender Law**, enabling purchases without tender formalities.
4. **Succession Documentation:** The Ministry plan must mandate all universities and hospitals to develop an official **"Command Succession Document"** identifying successors for all key responsibilities to ensure the command chain is not interrupted by personnel elimination.
5. **Infrastructure Priority:** The plan must establish governmental obligations requiring the Ministries of Energy, Petroleum, and Communications to guarantee **uninterrupted and absolute priority** provision of electricity, water, fuel, and communications to medical and health centers.

B. Mandatory Preparedness Functions (P1-P6)

The EOP must incorporate detailed plans for the following preparatory functions:

| Function Rule                      | Detail and Requirement                                       | Citation |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| **P1: Strategic Coordination**     | Must define mechanisms for both **intra-sectoral** (within MoH units) and **inter-sectoral** coordination (external agencies). Must include holding joint meetings, drafting a **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)**, and having it signed by the highest responsible authority of the organizations. |          |
| **P2: Safety & Hazard Assessment** | Must be conducted annually and reported to the higher level. Data collection and analysis must be performed by the responsible unit. |          |
| **P3: EOP Development**            | Must ensure the systematic recording of **lessons learned** from previous incidents and drills, including holding a lessons learned workshop within a maximum of two months after an incident's end. |          |
| **P4: Stockpiling**                | Must include **preparing a list of required supplies**, developing the relevant **protocol**, actively stockpiling, and performing **periodic control** of reserves (e.g., medicines, equipment). |          |
| **P5: Personnel Training**         | Must develop a **training matrix** specifying subject and manager/staff level (basic vs. specialized). Must include a **Crisis Management Training Record** for each staff member. |          |
| **P6: Personnel Drill**            | Must develop a **drill program** specifying subjects for different levels of managers and staff. Must create scenarios and drill evaluation protocols. Requires a **Crisis Management Drill Record** for each staff member. |          |

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part Two: Rules for Creating Implementing Checklists (Action-Response Documents)

While the EOP (Strategic Plan) provides the policy, the checklists and Incident Action Plan (IAP) provide the executable steps for the field. The Ministry Headquarters must define the strict rules for their creation to ensure effective implementation under crisis conditions.

1. Structural and Definitional Specifications

The checklist creation process must define the context and organizational roles explicitly.

| Rule Component                  | Requirement and Detail                                       | Citation |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| **Target Audience**             | Checklists designed for the Ministry/Headquarters level must contain defined procedures for **policy-making and decision-making** to expedite coordination and maintain a unified chain of command. |          |
| **Checklist Name & Type**       | Must be defined according to the main guideline document and specify the exact **Phase** (Preparedness Phase / Action-Response Phase). |          |
| **Crisis Scope**                | Must specify the exact crisis type (War / Mass Casualty Incidents or Sanctions) as defined in the main guideline. |          |
| **Roles (Process Owner/Actor)** | Must define the **Process Owner** (central department responsible for overseeing implementation) and the **Actor(s)/Implementer(s)** by **position/title**. |          |
| **Role Writing**                | Documents must be written for **defined organizational roles** (e.g., Hospital Director), **not for specific individuals** (e.g., "Mr. Smith"). Responsibilities must be **clear and unambiguous**. |          |
| **Reference Protocols**         | Must use protocols referenced in the Comprehensive Plan, localizing and adapting them to the specific conditions of a war or sanctions crisis. |          |

2. Operational Prerequisites Rules

Before listing any executive action, the checklist must define the conditions of initiation and completion.

1. **Checklist Activation Trigger:** Every process must have a **clear and specific trigger** that defines the exact starting point of the operation (e.g., activation upon the declaration of "Code Orange").
2. **Checklist Objective:** The final, **measurable goal** of the checklist's execution must be defined (e.g., Create a minimum of 50 vacant inpatient beds within the first 2 hours).
3. **Executive Steps Detailing:** For checklists in the Action-Response Phase, time-sensitive steps must be detailed by **time and responsible party** (e.g., Part 1: First 30 Minutes).
4. Content Formatting and Style Rules

To ensure rapid execution under severe psychological pressure, the format and language must follow strict guidelines.

1. **Action Language:** Actions must be short, directive, checkable, and must use **simple words, short sentences, and clear, direct, command-style verbs**.
2. **Clarity Mandate:** Complex language, long sentences, and ambiguous phrases must be **avoided**, as they lead to confusion and delays. Crisis documents must be understandable and executable in the shortest possible time.
3. **Content Alignment:** All actions must be **aligned with executive directives and protocols**.
4. **Table Structure:** The executive content should be organized in a table format with columns including **Action, Status, and Remarks/Report**.
5. **Status Checkability:** The **Status** options must be clear and checkable. For urgent items, acceptable options include **Executed, Communicated, Reported**. For other cases, **In Progress** or **Not Applicable (N/A)** can be used.
6. **Reporting Requirement:** The **Remarks / Report** column is mandatory for entering relevant explanations, detailed statistical reports, or coordination notes.
7. Accountability and Confirmation Rules

The checklist must conclude with a definitive confirmation section:

1. **Execution Confirmation:** A section for sign-off by the **Primary Actor or Commander** is mandatory, requiring the Full Name, Date & Time, and Signature to confirm successful implementation.
