Checklists are essential tools for frontline implementers and staff, but for Headquarters Experts (Ministry level), they require defined procedures for policy-making and decision-making to maintain a unified chain of command and coordination.

1. General Structural Specifications

The action plan protocols should align with standardized specifications:

• **Checklist Name:** Must be defined according to the main guideline document (e.g., Protocol for Reverse Evacuation and Capacity Generation).

• **Relevant Domain:** Must specify the relevant directorate or organization (e.g., Deputy Ministry of Treatment).

• **Crisis Scope:** Must define the specific crisis type (War/Sanctions/Mass Casualty Incidents).

• **Checklist Type:** Must specify the phase it addresses (Preparedness Phase / Action-Response Phase).

• **Reference Protocols:** Must reference higher-level, officially communicated protocols, localized and adapted to the specific conditions of a war or sanctions crisis.

2. Defining Roles and Responsibilities

The integrity of the plan relies on clearly defined roles to prevent disruption from personnel changes.

• **Process Owner:** Clearly define the central department or office responsible for communicating and overseeing the protocol's implementation (e.g., Center for Hospital Management and Clinical Excellence).

• **Actor(s) / Implementer(s):** Define the responsible person(s) by specific position/title within the operational level (e.g., Head Nurses, Clinical Departments, Headquarters Experts).

• **Organizational Roles:** Documents, especially checklists, must be written for defined organizational roles (e.g., Hospital Director, Facilities Manager, Clinical Supervisor), not for specific individuals, ensuring responsibilities are clear and unambiguous.

• **Operations Commander:** Identify the responsible individual at the operational level (e.g., Clinical Operations Commander).

3. Pre-Action Parameters

Before the actions themselves are listed, the following must be precisely established:

• **Checklist Activation Trigger:** A clear and specific trigger must be defined that determines the exact starting point of the operation, preventing premature or disastrously late responses (e.g., activation upon declaration of "Code Orange" or nationwide power outage lasting more than 30 minutes).

• **Checklist Objective:** The final, measurable goal of the checklist’s execution must be defined (e.g., Create a minimum of 50 vacant inpatient beds and completely halt all elective services within the first 2 hours).

• **Executive Steps Detailing:** If the actions are time-sensitive (typical for the action-response phase), the steps must be detailed by time and responsible party (e.g., Part 1: First 30 Minutes, commanded by the Clinical Operations Commander).

4. Checklist Content Formatting and Style Rules

The content itself must adhere to strict rules to ensure rapid and accurate execution under severe psychological pressure.

| Rule Component             | Requirement and Detail                                       | Rationale/Example                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Action Language**        | Must use simple words, short sentences, and clear, direct, command-style verbs. Actions must be short, directive, and checkable. | **Good Example:** "Store safe drinking water for 72 hours.". |
| **Complexity Avoidance**   | Complex language, long sentences, and ambiguous phrases must be avoided, as they lead to confusion and delays. | **Bad Example:** *Necessary preparations for the provision and storage of drinking water required for staff and patients for a three-day period should be made as soon as possible...*. |
| **Content Alignment**      | All actions must be aligned with executive directives and protocols. | This ensures consistency across the command chain (Ministry to Frontline). |
| **Table Organization**     | The executive content should be organized in a table format containing at least the following columns: Action, Status, and Remarks/Report. | This provides a structure for execution and reporting.       |
| **Status Options**         | The status options must be clear and checkable. For urgent items, status options must include definitive completion steps (e.g., **Executed, Communicated, Reported**). Other cases may use **In Progress** or **Not Applicable (N/A)**. | Ensures accurate tracking of time-sensitive actions.         |
| **Remarks/Report**         | A space for relevant explanations, detailed statistical reports, or necessary coordination notes must be included (e.g., recording vacant bed counts, noting coordination with the University EOC). | Allows for accountability and necessary context regarding the action taken. |
| **Execution Confirmation** | A final section for sign-off must be included for the primary actor or commander, detailing Full Name, Date & Time, and Signature. | Confirms successful implementation and accountability at the operational level. |
