Checklists are operational tools developed from the strategic plan, designed for rapid and accurate execution at the local level. These must adhere to strict rules for structure, content, and accountability.

1. Structural and Definitional Specifications
2. **Target Audience Definition:** Checklists must be designed for both **Managers/Headquarters Experts** (focusing on defined procedures for policy-making/decision-making) and **Frontline Implementers and Staff** (providing fast, directive, and detail-free tools).
3. **Mandatory Profile Data:** The checklist must define:

  ◦ **Checklist Name:** Defined according to the main guideline document.

  ◦ **Relevant Domain:** The responsible directorate or organization (e.g., Deputy Ministry of Treatment).

  ◦ **Crisis Scope:** Specified as **War / Mass Casualty Incidents**.

  ◦ **Checklist Type:** Specified as the **Preparedness Phase**.

3. **Protocol Referencing:** Must reference protocols included in the Comprehensive Plan, ensuring they are **localized and adapted** to the specific capabilities and structure of the university's regional hospitals.
4. Role Assignment and Pre-Action Rules
5. **Role-Based Writing:** Documents must be written for **defined organizational roles** (e.g., Hospital Director, Facilities Manager, Clinical Supervisor), **not** for specific individuals ("Mr. Smith"). Responsibilities must be **clear and unambiguous**.
6. **Role Identification:** The checklist must identify the **Process Owner** (central department overseeing the protocol) and the **Actor(s)/Implementer(s)** by position/title.
7. **Activation Trigger:** A **clear and specific trigger** must be defined to determine the exact starting point of the operation, preventing premature or late responses.
8. **Objective Definition:** The **Checklist Objective** must be defined, representing the final, measurable goal of the execution.
9. **Step Detail (If applicable to preparedness actions):** If actions are time-sensitive, executive steps must be detailed by time and responsible party.
10. Content Formatting and Accountability Rules
11. **Directive Language:** Actions must be short, directive, checkable, and must use **simple words, short sentences, and clear, direct, command-style verbs**. Complex language or ambiguous phrases must be avoided.
12. **Table Organization:** Executive steps must be presented in a table format with the required columns: **Action, Status, and Remarks / Report**.
13. **Status Options:** Status options must be configured based on the action type and must be clear and checkable (e.g., Executed, Communicated, Reported, In Progress, or Not Applicable).
14. **Reporting Requirement:** The **Remarks / Report** column is mandatory for entering relevant explanations, detailed statistical reports (e.g., inventory counts), or necessary coordination notes.
15. **Execution Confirmation:** A final **Execution Confirmation** section is mandatory for sign-off by the primary actor or commander, including the Full Name, Date & Time, and Signature, confirming successful completion.
