Checklists serve as the fast, directive tools for Headquarters Experts and Frontline Implementers at the University and Hospital levels during the response operation.

1. Structural and Definitional Specifications

Checklists must define the context, command structure, and implementation prerequisites precisely:

1. **Target Audience:** Checklists for the University/Hospital level are designed for **Managers/Headquarters Experts** (focusing on policy-making/decision-making procedures) and **Frontline Implementers and Staff** (focusing on fast, directive actions).
2. **Mandatory Profile Data:** The checklist must specify:

  ◦ **Checklist Name:** Defined according to the main guideline document.

  ◦ **Relevant Domain:** The relevant directorate or organization (e.g., Deputy Ministry of Treatment).

  ◦ **Crisis Scope:** Must specify **War / Mass Casualty Incidents**.

  ◦ **Checklist Type:** Must specify the **Action-Response Phase**.

3. **Reference Protocols:** Must use **higher-level, officially communicated protocols** (e.g., national directives), which are then **localized and adapted** to the specific capabilities and structure of the regional hospitals.
4. **Role Assignment:** Documents must be written for **defined organizational roles** (e.g., Hospital Director, Facilities Manager, Clinical Supervisor), **not for specific individuals**. Responsibilities must be **clear and unambiguous**.

  ◦ Identify the **Process Owner** (central department overseeing implementation).

  ◦ Identify the **Actor(s) / Implementer(s)** by position/title.

  ◦ Identify the **Operations Commander**.

5. **Activation Trigger:** A **clear and specific trigger** must be defined that determines the exact starting point of the operation (e.g., activation upon the declaration of "Code Red" by the University EOC).
6. **Objective Definition:** The checklist must define the **Checklist Objective**, which is the final, measurable goal of the execution (e.g., "Create a minimum of 50 vacant inpatient beds...").
7. **Executive Steps Detailing:** Time-sensitive steps (typical in the action-response phase) must be detailed by **time and responsible party**.
8. Content Formatting and Style Rules

The content must ensure rapid and accurate execution under severe psychological pressure.

1. **Action Language:** Actions must be short, directive, checkable, and use **simple words, short sentences, and clear, direct, command-style verbs**. Complex language, long sentences, and ambiguous phrases must be avoided.
2. **Table Organization:** The executive content must be organized in a table format containing at least the columns for **Action, Status, and Remarks/Report**.
3. **Status Options:** Status options must be clear and checkable. For urgent items, options must include **Executed, Communicated, Reported**. In other cases, **In Progress** or **Not Applicable (N/A)** can be used.
4. **Reporting Requirement:** The **Remarks / Report** column is mandatory for entering relevant explanations, detailed statistical reports (e.g., listing vacant capacity), or necessary coordination notes.
5. Accountability Rule
6. **Execution Confirmation:** A final section is mandatory for **sign-off** by the Primary Actor or Commander, detailing Full Name, Date & Time, and Signature, confirming successful implementation.
