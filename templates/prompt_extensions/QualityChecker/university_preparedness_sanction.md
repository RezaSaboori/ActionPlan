Checklists are operational tools that expedite action in a crisis. Rules for their structure, content, and accountability are mandatory, regardless of the subject matter.

1. Structural and Definitional Specifications (Part One: Specifications)
2. **Target Audience Definition:** Checklists must be designed for two primary groups:

  ◦ **Managers and Headquarters Experts (University Level):** Must include defined procedures for **policy-making and decision-making** to expedite coordination.

  ◦ **Frontline Implementers and Staff:** Must be a tool that is fast, directive, and free of extraneous details.

2. **Checklist Profile Data:** The document must contain the following required profile elements:

  ◦ **Checklist Name:** Defined according to the main guideline document.

  ◦ **Relevant Domain:** The relevant directorate or organization (e.g., Deputy Ministry of Treatment).

  ◦ **Crisis Scope:** Must specify **Sanctions** or **War / Mass Casualty Incidents**.

  ◦ **Checklist Type:** Must specify the phase it addresses (**Preparedness Phase** / Action-Response Phase).

3. **Protocol Referencing:** It is preferred to use protocols already included in the Comprehensive Plan, localizing and adapting **higher-level, officially communicated protocols** (national or international documents) to the specific conditions and structure of the university's regional capabilities.
4. **Role-Based Writing Rule:** Checklists must **not** be written for specific individuals (e.g., "Mr. Smith") but for **defined organizational roles** (e.g., Hospital Director, Clinical Supervisor). This ensures that responsibilities are **clear and unambiguous** and are not disrupted by personnel changes.
5. **Role Identification:** The checklist must identify the **Process Owner** (the central department overseeing the protocol), the **Actor(s) / Implementer(s)** by position/title, and the **Operations Commander**.
6. Pre-Action Parameters
7. **Activation Trigger:** Every process must have a **clear and specific trigger** that defines the exact starting point of the operation, preventing premature or disastrously late responses.
8. **Checklist Objective:** The final, measurable goal of the checklist's execution must be defined.
9. **Executive Steps Detailing:** Where time-sensitive actions are required, executive steps must be detailed by time and responsible party.
10. Content Formatting and Accountability Rules
11. **Directive Language Mandate:** Actions must be short, directive, checkable, and must use **simple words, short sentences, and clear, direct, command-style verbs**. Complex language, long sentences, and ambiguous phrases must be avoided, as they lead to confusion and delays under severe psychological pressure.
12. **Alignment:** Actions must be aligned with executive directives and protocols.
13. **Table Organization:** The executive content must be organized in a table format containing the columns: **Action, Status, and Remarks / Report**.
14. **Status Options:** Status options must be clear and checkable, such as **Executed, Communicated, Reported, In Progress, or Not Applicable (N/A)**.
15. **Reporting Requirement:** The **Remarks / Report** column is mandatory for entering relevant explanations, detailed statistical reports (e.g., inventory counts), or coordination notes.
16. **Execution Confirmation:** A final section for **sign-off** by the primary actor or commander is mandatory, including their Full Name, Date & Time, and Signature, confirming successful completion.
