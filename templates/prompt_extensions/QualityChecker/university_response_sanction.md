Checklists serve as definitive, executable tools for the IAP, designed for rapid execution under severe pressure. Checklists for the University level are targeted at both managers (policy/decision procedures) and frontline staff (directive actions).

1. Structural and Definitional Specifications
2. **Mandatory Profile Data:** The checklist document must specify the following items from the main guideline:

  ◦ **Checklist Name:** Defined according to the main guideline document.

  ◦ **Relevant Domain:** The relevant directorate or organization (e.g., Deputy Ministry of Treatment).

  ◦ **Crisis Scope:** Must specify **Sanctions** or **War / Mass Casualty Incidents**.

  ◦ **Checklist Type:** Must specify the **Action-Response Phase**.

2. **Protocol Referencing:** It is preferred to use protocols already included in the Comprehensive Plan, localizing and adapting **higher-level, officially communicated protocols** (national directives) to the specific conditions and capabilities of the University's hospitals.
3. **Role-Based Writing Rule:** Documents must be written for **defined organizational roles** (e.g., Hospital Director, Logistics Manager, Clinical Supervisor), **not** for specific individuals. This ensures responsibilities are **clear and unambiguous** and prevents process disruption due to personnel changes.
4. **Role Identification:** The checklist must clearly define the **Process Owner** (central department responsible for overseeing implementation), the **Actor(s) / Implementer(s)** (by position/title), and the **Operations Commander**.
5. **Activation and Objective:**

  ◦ **Activation Trigger:** A clear and specific trigger must be defined that determines the exact starting point of the operation, preventing premature or late responses.

  ◦ **Checklist Objective:** Defines the final, measurable goal of the checklist’s execution.

  ◦ **Executive Steps:** For time-sensitive steps typical in the Action-Response Phase, the steps must be detailed by **time and responsible party**.

2. Content Formatting and Style Rules
3. **Directive Language Mandate:** Actions must be short, directive, checkable, and must use **simple words, short sentences, and clear, direct, command-style verbs**. Complex language, long sentences, and ambiguous phrases must be strictly avoided, as they lead to confusion and delays.
4. **Alignment:** All checklist actions must be **aligned with executive directives and protocols**.
5. **Table Organization:** The executable content must be organized in a table format containing the columns: **Action, Status, and Remarks / Report**.
6. **Status Checkability:** Status options must be clear and checkable. For urgent items, status options must include definitive steps such as **Executed, Communicated, or Reported**. Other options like **In Progress** or **Not Applicable (N/A)** can also be used.
7. **Remarks/Report Requirement:** The **Remarks / Report** column is mandatory for entering relevant explanations, detailed statistical reports (e.g., vacant bed counts), or necessary coordination notes.
8. Accountability Rule
9. **Execution Confirmation:** A final section for **Execution Confirmation** is mandatory, requiring the **Full Name, Date & Time, and Signature** of the primary actor or commander.
